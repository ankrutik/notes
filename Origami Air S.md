> We use 15g of coffee for this recipe, finely ground. (around #6.5 on EK grinder)
> 
> By grinding finely, you can extract the goodness quickly and intensely, which lets you finish the extraction before it starts dripping any unpleasant taste. You can also grind it coarse if you prefer a light extraction.
> 
> Keep the water temperature relatively low, around 88-90c, to avoid any unpleasant flavor. The key is to finish brewing on time. Make sure to rinse the filter beforehand.
> 
> Pour 40g of hot water within the first 30 seconds. During the next 30 seconds slowly pour 130g of hot water. This is to extract all the goodness in coffee efficiently. 
> 
> Pour the remaining 270g at once before the timer hits 1:20. Then remove the dripper even there is some water left in the dripper and finish the extraction.
