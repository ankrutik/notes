# Mise-en-scene
Tags: #film 

> All the things that are “put in the scene”: the setting, the decor, the lighting, the costumes, the performance etc. Narrative films often **manipulate the elements of mise-en-scene**, such as decor, costume, and acting to **intensify or undermine the ostensible significance** of a particular scene.
