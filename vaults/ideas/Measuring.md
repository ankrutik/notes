Thumb-and-pencil is better when flexibility is needed.

Proportional Divider is better when scale conversions are needed.

Use thumb and pencil for:
- smaller details
- relation of details

Use proportional divider for:
- scale conversions
- larger measurements 

When starting to sketch, choose a position to sit such that you will **not be disturbed for at least 10 minutes**. Do not change your position.

The Human eye may have 180 degrees vision but only 45 degrees is in focus. Be aware of this and choose to **keep your entire scene in this field of vision**.

Consider parallax and perspective when determining relative size of parts. For example, the size and position of eyes are affected by perspective when the face is off center.

## Ideas for proportions
- Building up:
	1. Draw 1st part. 
	2. Measure distant from 1st part to 2nd part in units of measure of 1st part. *How many 1st parts can fit between the 1st part and the second part?*
	3. Draw 2nd part in proportion to 1st part. *What are the dimensions of 2nd part in relation to 1st part?*
	4. Repeat 2 to 3. Use multiple parts as a single part to measure distances.
	5. How are parts aligning to other parts vertically and horizontally?
