# Notes on Listening to Jazz

[TOC]

# Overview

Typical structure of jazz

- melody/theme played a few times
- each musician will improvise solos over harmonies/chords of the melody
- melody/theme played at the end

Each musician will not simply just play the chords but will decorate/flourish/experiment with the notes of the chord.

One musician will come up for the solo, the other will respond to him or simply support him.

Precision or steady tempo of a computer would have made machines better at jazz. Slight human imprefections, intended or not, makes the professions good. Human touch.

# Observe

Don't have to answer the the following questions verbally, even to yourself! 

Just observe the music for the following points. 

- tempo: beats per minute
  - **what is the tempo** and how are the musicians doing at that tempo? is it:
    - fast tempo
    - slow tempo
    - tempo slightly faster than the human heartbeat
  - do they sound in command irrespective of the tempo?
- group dynamics
  - **rhythemic cohesion**, smoothness in interaction between the musicians
  - ability to enter **flow state**
  - mastery of the beat
- phrases: a piece of music played by the musician in short breaks
  - how do they **shape the phrases**?
  - **is the musician playing the song or is the song controlling the musician** in terms of tempo and speed?
  - **clear intentionality on each note** of the musician from the first to the last note of a phrase. did they just give up because the ran out of breath?
  - what is the musician doing to the notes? Growl, smear, flat, sharp the note!
- dynamics is variation in volume thru the performance
  - are **dynamics used actively to shape** the performance?
  - **dynamics used in phrases**?
  - mediocre performance will just be loud and fast, no variation
- skill of the musician
  - for the greats, **technicality is no longer a hurdle to focus on just self-expression** due to their mastery 
  - does the musician just **mimic** others?
  - musician's **personality off-stage** will reflect on the performance
  - A work of art will force us to **adapt to it**. The usual shallow entertainment is factory made to the likes of the masses.
  - **spontaneity** in the performance? you can't measure it, only feel it!
- listening for structure, technical:
  - follow the bass for pulse of the tempo, if not the drums
  - 4 beats make a bar, **how many bars of solo** is each musician using?
  - hear jazz as a sequence of phrases then grasp the underlying structure
- listening as meditation, relaxation:
  - eyes closed, soft focus on the sounds
  - I end up visualizing the wind instruments like a caligraphy brush drawing shapes
- technical, jazz deserves the fidelity!
  - if possible listen to lossless files (FLAC, WAV, ALAC)
  - if possible listen on good headphones thru an amplifier
  - if possible form an equilateral triangle between you and your speakers facing towards you
  - if possible the tweeters of the speakers should be at ear level
  - check if stereo signal is being played correctly by your hardware
  - if possible lights off, warm colour lamp
  - if possible early morning calm
  - if you want to listen to louder and chaotic tracks, use headphones. others may not like it.
- evaluation by your tastes
  - how is the overall "sound" of the performance? do you like the mood?
  - are the musicians cool or not?
  - is your head bobbing, fingers clicking, arms swaying, legs tapping?
  - is something different happening in the performance than what you have already come across?
  - would you like to continue listening?
  - would you like to listen to something calmer or louder?
  - music's great but overwhelmed? take a break.
