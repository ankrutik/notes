# Idea
- When soloing over a chord progression (played in background), **some notes feel weird even though they are part of the scale.**
- Learn how to access **notes in the scale that are part of the chord** playing in the back.
- *How do you know those notes are there?* 

# Concept
- Consider the Major Pentatonic scale....
	- Major pentatonic in open position (nut) is in the key of G.
	- Hence it is considered to be a G shaped scale.
	- Consider notes in G Major scale. 
		- G Am Bm C D Em F
	- Remember this. Will use this later.
- Consider C Major Pentatonic...
	- C is on the 8th Fret of low E string. Capo the first line of notes on the 8th Fret.
	- Consider capo as nut and hold G chord shape. 
		- You may be holding a **G chord shape** but you are actually holding a **C chord**.
	- Consider capo as nut and hold C chord shape. 
		- You may be holding a **C chord shape** but you are actually holding a **F chord**.
	- These notes that you get by holding the shapes will give you the notes.
- Minor pentatonic scale will be a Em chord shaped scale.
	- Because root of scale in open position falls on E note.
	- Also, G and Em are major-minor relative pairs.
	- Consider notes in E minor scale. 
		- Em F G Am Bm C D
- *For chord playing in the background, what chord shape will I have to hold on the scale to get notes to that sound good with that chord?*
	- The notes that will occur on that **chord shape** are the one I need to end my phrases with.

# Illustrations
### Example 1 Consider root of C.
- Major scale notes: C D E F G A B
- Your rhythm guitarist chooses to play a 1, 4 chord progression
	- That is chords C and F
- You choose to the major pentatonic scale to solo over. 
	- Maintain same root as rhythm, we choose C major pentatonic scale.
	- We know major pentatonic scale is G shaped.
	- In G major scale, 1, 4 will be G and C.
	- Solo strategy:
		- C chord, G chord shape
		- F chord, C chord shape
		- In other words, when C chord will be playing, end phrases with notes that fall on the G chord shape on the scale.

### Example 2. Consider root of A.
- Major scale notes: A Bm C#m D E F#m
- Your rhythm guitarist chooses to play a 1, 2 chord progression
	- That is chords A and Bm
- You choose to the major pentatonic scale to solo over. 
	- Maintain same root as rhythm, we choose A major pentatonic scale.
	- We know major pentatonic scale is G shaped.
	- In G major scale, 1, 2 will be G and Am.
	- Solo strategy:
		- A chord, G chord shape
		- Bm chord, Am chord shape
		- In other words, when A chord will be playing, end phrases with notes that fall on the G chord shape on the scale.

### Example 3. Consider root of C minor.
- Minor scale notes: C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb
- Your rhythm guitarist chooses to play a 1, 4 chord progression
	- That is chords Cm and Fm
- You choose to the minor pentatonic scale to solo over. 
	- Maintain same root as rhythm, we choose C minor pentatonic scale.
	- We know minor pentatonic scale is Em shaped.
	- In E minor scale, 1, 4 will be Em and Am.
	- Solo strategy:
		- Cm chord, Em chord shape
		- Fm chord, Am chord shape
		- In other words, when Cm chord will be playing, end phrases with notes that fall on the Em chord shape on the scale.

# Practice
- Method 1
	- Arpeggiate on chord shapes.
	- Deliberately play other notes to see how they do not fit.
- Method 2
	- End phrases on the notes of the chords.
- Method 3
	- Start and end phrases on the notes of the chords.
- Method 4
	- Walk over scale. When you hit a note that fits, jump over next few notes to another notes that fits.
