Open source and works for most simple use cases. 

Features like text overlays and scene transitions are called **filters**. 

Filters are applied to video clips. 

**Split a clip** for the time that a filter is applicable and then apply the filter. 
For example, of a text overlay should show for a certain time period, clip the video clip for that time period and apply the text overlay for that entire clip. 

**Key frames** (simple and advanced) can be used to give motion to text overlays.

When setting background colour to text overlays, set the **background alpha value** (0-225) to specify the opacity of the colour. 

Add images, videos, audio to the **playlist** and pull it into **timelines**. 

To make timeline position changes to all subsequent elements on a timeline, use the **ripple** button. **Ripple across timeline** takes those changes to elements of all timelines. 

### Sourcing graphics
- Export slide backgrounds from Powerpoint to png files to use as backgrounds in videos. 
- Look for vector graphics or transparent background png files for elements like arrows.
- Diagrams can be make in draw.io
