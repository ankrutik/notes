Tags: #plants #routine

**Select plants to be watered** by using moisture meter to check soil. Some candidates: 
- dry soil
- between dry and moist for plants that need moist soil

> [!important]
> Avoid disturbing the position of the plants as much as possible. 


**Aerate soil** 
- when using plastic pots, press the pots to loosen the soil within
- by using a small trowel 
	- use this as sparingly as possible, I've hurt roots of plants
	- use this once a month
	- in a pull up motion along the sides of the pot 
	- away from the main root as much as possible
	- be gentle

**Observe roots** 
	- to be white and healthy
	- If not, isolate plants that have unhealthy roots or root rot.

**Observe leaves**
	- plump and bounce
	- **Yellowing** can indicate
		- if soil is observed to be wet most of the time, over-watering
		- if watering is correct, too much sunlight
	- **Browning** can indicates 
		- if watering is correct, too much sunlight
		- if light is correct, under-watering
	- **Limp-ness** can indicate 
		- if watering is correct, a thirsty plant

If above corrections do not work, there might be root rot:
- rotten roots
- leaves not recovering

**Common rules when watering**
- water in spiral manner from the main root
- do not water board the pot
	- pour little, wait for it to drain out the bottom
	- repeat till you see the first few drops seeping out, then stop

**Amount of watering**
- soil is dry, roots are healthy
	- wait for water to seep out at bottom
- soil is moist, plant needs moist soil
	- just enough to keep the soil moist
- plant is recovering from root rot
	- 2 tablespoons of water near main stem
