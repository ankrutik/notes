# Experiments
1. brightness +1/2; contrast +5/6
2. brightness +1/2; contrast -1/2
3. default
4. contrast -1/2

When brightness is increased past default, details in brightly lit area are lost (2). Similarly in low lit areas (1). Here (3) looked best.

1. saturation +1/2; density +1/2
2. saturation +1/2
3. density +1/2

Use density +1/4, saturation +1/2
