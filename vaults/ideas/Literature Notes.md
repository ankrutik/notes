## Where/When to take them?
When consuming literature like:
- articles
- books
- films
- podcasts
- recorded lectures, seminars, etc.

# How to take them?
- These should be **in your own words always**. Redescribing the idea helps **internalize** it.
- Each note should not be more than 3 to 5 sentences.
- Maintain web links or bibliographical references.

See below how literature notes and fleeting notes can be interchanged.

## When not to take them and gray areas?
Some pieces of literature are so dense with ideas that you would want to take lots of notes on them. In that case, start a new literature note.

Sometimes you might **not have the time to take notes in your own words**, as is expected when making literature notes. 
- In that case, **start a new fleeting note** for that peice of literature to do as-is copy-pasting. 
- Then **create a separate literature note** when you are reviewing that fleeting note.
- Consider **bookmarking that literature** and attempting it when you have the time.

### Note down what you want to remember not what you feel like noting down
- What you want to remember is something you find interesting or may find useful. Judge note-worthiness on this.

# What to do with them?
- Reviewed into permanent notes.
- Maintained as a record of the piece of literature that you consumed. This should not contain any other notes. 
- Any notes on additions of your own thoughts or ideas should be marked in italics.
