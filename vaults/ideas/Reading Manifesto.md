# Reading Manifesto

## First pass
Read it without much analysis or need to take notes.

Experience the matter as the author intended it.

Occasionally, evaluate the quality of your reading. *Can you explain or even recall the last paragraph that you just read?*

> [!warning] 
> If thoughts of ideas or actions pop up, write them down for later and get back to reading. This is important because you'd never finish reading. Reading needs to be a conscious effort.

At most, mark a line in the side to points where you'd want to return. It's your own book, use a pencil or a pen. Ballpoint is better as it won't bleed thru the paper.

## Second pass
Choosing to make [[Literature Notes]] or [[Permanent Notes]]
- Make literature notes only if the article/book/film seems to be recorded on its own.
	*- Pull out points to make consolidated, permanent notes in later passes.*
- Otherwise take snippets directly into permanent notes.

Consider marking those notes for review later in a third pass.

## Third pass
Optional.

Go thru notes and see if you can do any of the following:
- bold certain keywords
- reword sentences to make them more succinct
- remove entire parts if they are redundant due to notes added later
- will it help if this note popped up when looking at some other note? Find and add links.
- Pull out rules and format them as callouts or admonitions.

**Pull out sections to make consolidated permanent notes.**

Do you need to schedule spaced repetitions?

## Revision pass
Look at the markings in the book and read only those markings.

Open up the literature note and see outgoing links to all permanent notes.
