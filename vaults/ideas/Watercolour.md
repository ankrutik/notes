For highlights, leave the part of the paper blank.
Bright tones -> mid tones -> dark tones -> shadow tones. Apply paint in that order. 
Learn when to stop. 

## Try this
Mark with pencil and sketch directly with watercolour.

## Painting
Use mid and dark tones to draw details over bright and mid tones.

## Paper
Use 300 GSM paper for watercolours.

## Brush
Roll the brush on the pallete or on the serated cap of the water penbrush to bring the brush to a point.
You might need to do this very often.

## Preparing colour
Mix the colour/hue for the mid or dark tone.
- Use more water for highlights.
- Apply multiple layers for dark and shadow areas.

## Washes
Dampen paper entirely. Use brush full with colour. Do not lift midway between strokes.

### Flat Wash
Keep uniform. Wash may appear inconsistent when wet, wait for it to dry.

### Graded Wash
Add or reduce water on brush as you keep moving along the gradient.
