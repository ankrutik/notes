	- democracy, autocracy, demogaugerie
	- the opposition is in a way, also elected by the public 
	- problem of majority in a democracy
	- given the current prevalence of devices being hacked, EVMs should be rejected in the public common sense 
	- opposition parties should protest about the EVMs with the EC and not the governing party
		- earlier than after the elections

	- tyranny is the step child of democracy, Plato 
	- paranoia is the seed of repression
	- a tyranical power will not let go of power easily, the democratic transition of rule will not be smooth
	- all overreaches will be justified as nationalism
	- no evident of regression can alarm their supporters
	- even private demurring becomes difficult, please are scared or talk in hushed voices 
	- institutionally and psychologically we are already inhabiting a tyranny although the violence might not be in your face

	- Imo, why is Rahul Gandhi considered "leader of the opposition"? Do all other smaller or regional parties see him as the leader of the collective opposition?  
	- BJP's popularity
		- BJP controls only half the states, not popular with non-Hindi speaking states
		- global approval rating is probably considering the NRI diaspora as well, electoral support within India says otherwise
	- India's political transformation
		- 2014
				- de-facto ethnic democracy
				- elections, media, judiciary not very impacted
		- 2014-2017
			- life gets difficult for minorities
			- unchecked vigilantism; cow slaughter and love jihad
		- 2019
			- elections
			- CAA: only non-Muslim refugees from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan elig for citizenship
			- Article 370
			- laws resisting to inter-religious marriages
			- going towarfs de jure ethnic democracy
			- authoritarianism
	- transformation of judiciary
		- BJP wants to change the way judges are elected, judiciary resisted
		- center sits on appointment of judges leading to vacancies
		- judiciary stops nominating judges that center will not appoint 
		- validates any law that center passes, not taking a stand
	- scenarios
		- political upheaval due to opposition leader
		- public protests due to strong civil society
		- they get away with it
			- more likely this because both civil society and judiciary is weak
	- big question is how thing will go forth after Modi leaves
	- push factor: Partition, Pakistan's support of jihadists, bomb blast
	- pull factor: Hindu-ization of society
	- emergence of middle class, their search for identity and gurus, BJP co-opting both identity and gurus
	- no face for the Prime Minister on the opposition side

	- simple timeline of the effects of Hindenburg reveal of Adani
