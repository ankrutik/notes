	- democracy, autocracy, demogaugerie
	- the opposition is in a way, also elected by the public 
	- problem of majority in a democracy
	- given the current prevalence of devices being hacked, EVMs should be rejected in the public common sense 
	- opposition parties should protest about the EVMs with the EC and not the governing party
		- earlier than after the elections

	- tyranny is the step child of democracy, Plato 
	- paranoia is the seed of repression
	- a tyranical power will not let go of power easily, the democratic transition of rule will not be smooth
	- all overreaches will be justified as nationalism
	- no evident of regression can alarm their supporters
	- even private demurring becomes difficult, please are scared or talk in hushed voices 
	- institutionally and psychologically we are already inhabiting a tyranny although the violence might not be in your face

	- Imo, why is Rahul Gandhi considered "leader of the opposition"? Do all other smaller or regional parties see him as the leader of the collective opposition?  
	- BJP's popularity
		- BJP controls only half the states, not popular with non-Hindi speaking states
		- global approval rating is probably considering the NRI diaspora as well, electoral support within India says otherwise
	- India's political transformation
		- 2014
				- de-facto ethnic democracy
				- elections, media, judiciary not very impacted
		- 2014-2017
			- life gets difficult for minorities
			- unchecked vigilantism; cow slaughter and love jihad
		- 2019
			- elections
			- CAA: only non-Muslim refugees from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan elig for citizenship
			- Article 370
			- laws resisting to inter-religious marriages
			- going towarfs de jure ethnic democracy
			- authoritarianism
	- transformation of judiciary
		- BJP wants to change the way judges are elected, judiciary resisted
		- center sits on appointment of judges leading to vacancies
		- judiciary stops nominating judges that center will not appoint 
		- validates any law that center passes, not taking a stand
	- scenarios
		- political upheaval due to opposition leader
		- public protests due to strong civil society
		- they get away with it
			- more likely this because both civil society and judiciary is weak
	- big question is how thing will go forth after Modi leaves
	- push factor: Partition, Pakistan's support of jihadists, bomb blast
	- pull factor: Hindu-ization of society
	- emergence of middle class, their search for identity and gurus, BJP co-opting both identity and gurus
	- no face for the Prime Minister on the opposition side

	- *We don’t come to the movies as blank slates; we bring ourselves and our history.*
	- *When _our guy_ is the target, what also becomes apparent is that the retributive process is ugly. If we must incorporate a prescriptive morality into our reception of art, at least let it rest on epistemological rigor—on doing our due diligence. Twitter hordes all too often demand that we repudiate our idols in an instant, without second thoughts, before the murk of rumor and uncertainty has been cleared up and contexts understood. Have we paused to examine the evidence? And even if guilt has been established, behavioral norms are changing fast. Maybe we should be less dogmatic about our operative definitions of right and wrong.*
	- *An ethics that is casual about proof and doesn’t question the assumptions of the moment looks disturbingly like mob justice.*

	- "bail, not jail" should be the norm for people across all backgrounds/privileges
	- As of December 2021, out of 5.4L around 4.7L prisoners are undertrial
	- experimental interim bail given to accused in Lakhimpur Kheri violence
