	- democracy, autocracy, demogaugerie
	- the opposition is in a way, also elected by the public 
	- problem of majority in a democracy
	- given the current prevalence of devices being hacked, EVMs should be rejected in the public common sense 
	- opposition parties should protest about the EVMs with the EC and not the governing party
		- earlier than after the elections

	- tyranny is the step child of democracy, Plato 
	- paranoia is the seed of repression
	- a tyranical power will not let go of power easily, the democratic transition of rule will not be smooth
	- all overreaches will be justified as nationalism
	- no evident of regression can alarm their supporters
	- even private demurring becomes difficult, please are scared or talk in hushed voices 
	- institutionally and psychologically we are already inhabiting a tyranny although the violence might not be in your face

	- Imo, why is Rahul Gandhi considered "leader of the opposition"? Do all other smaller or regional parties see him as the leader of the collective opposition?  
	- BJP's popularity
		- BJP controls only half the states, not popular with non-Hindi speaking states
		- global approval rating is probably considering the NRI diaspora as well, electoral support within India says otherwise
	- India's political transformation
		- 2014
				- de-facto ethnic democracy
				- elections, media, judiciary not very impacted
		- 2014-2017
			- life gets difficult for minorities
			- unchecked vigilantism; cow slaughter and love jihad
		- 2019
			- elections
			- CAA: only non-Muslim refugees from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan elig for citizenship
			- Article 370
			- laws resisting to inter-religious marriages
			- going towarfs de jure ethnic democracy
			- authoritarianism
	- transformation of judiciary
		- BJP wants to change the way judges are elected, judiciary resisted
		- center sits on appointment of judges leading to vacancies
		- judiciary stops nominating judges that center will not appoint 
		- validates any law that center passes, not taking a stand
	- scenarios
		- political upheaval due to opposition leader
		- public protests due to strong civil society
		- they get away with it
			- more likely this because both civil society and judiciary is weak
	- big question is how thing will go forth after Modi leaves
	- push factor: Partition, Pakistan's support of jihadists, bomb blast
	- pull factor: Hindu-ization of society
	- emergence of middle class, their search for identity and gurus, BJP co-opting both identity and gurus
	- no face for the Prime Minister on the opposition side 
- [It’s Okay to Like Good Art by Bad People by Judith Shulevitz](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/05/separate-art-from-artist-cancel-culture-monsters-book/673497/)
	- *We don’t come to the movies as blank slates; we bring ourselves and our history.*
	- *When _our guy_ is the target, what also becomes apparent is that the retributive process is ugly. If we must incorporate a prescriptive morality into our reception of art, at least let it rest on epistemological rigor—on doing our due diligence. Twitter hordes all too often demand that we repudiate our idols in an instant, without second thoughts, before the murk of rumor and uncertainty has been cleared up and contexts understood. Have we paused to examine the evidence? And even if guilt has been established, behavioral norms are changing fast. Maybe we should be less dogmatic about our operative definitions of right and wrong.*
	- *An ethics that is casual about proof and doesn’t question the assumptions of the moment looks disturbingly like mob justice.*

	- "bail, not jail" should be the norm for people across all backgrounds/privileges
	- As of December 2021, out of 5.4L around 4.7L prisoners are undertrial
	- experimental interim bail given to accused in Lakhimpur Kheri violence

	- major powers will always have influence networks in other countries and regions 
		- what matters is if they are used to 
			- subvert democracy
				- influence elections 
				- confuse information consumers
	- China's influence is much more in other south East Asian countries around India than India itself 
		- attempts greatly increased in Xi's regime 
	- paper Global Times 
		- used by China to send out information about its policies or discourse to world and see the response it garners 
	- China wanted to develop its own Al Jazeera with English news outlet like Sixth Tone 
		- even hired good journalists 
			- but couldn't develop it because of how stifling it is generally 
	- not made progress with soft power like entertainment and software too because of the same stifling approaches 
	- news outlet Xinhua has been China's most effective information tool 
	- US approach to banning tiktok 
		- most of tiktok's problems are problems that any social media app would have mostly with regards to user privacy 
		- it'd be better to introduce better laws to govern all social media apps than single out and ban one 
		- tiktok data is stored on servers on China is a problem since US laws might not have influence on how that data is used 
	- Chinese and Russian media are know to collaborate to spread misinformation 
	- the more a country fails as a democracy, the more China's authoritarianism will seem appealing to its people 
		- if governments start labelling certain news outlets as unreliable then Chinese and Russian news outlets can gain following because people can't differentiate on which media outlet to trust

	- congress is still not publically clear on its ideology like the BJP is
		- possibly because BJP has a simplified and hardlined ideology whereas Congress has to be subtle
	- but still a long way from the time Rahul Gandhi tried appeasement by performing Puja and wearing a janeu
	- #watchlist/politics after Congress win in Karnataka 2023, will Congress go ahead with following actions that may go against the Hindu base in the state and others in North
		- ban Bajrang Dal
		- revoke ban on Hijab 
		- release caste census of 2015

	- After electoral loss in KarnatakaBJP supporters and spokepersons have gone beserk 
		- on media and news. 
		- In other states, they are intensifying their right leanings.
		- many discussions of giving up on Modi
		- #watchlist/politics Will it be beneficial for Congress to allow this to happen and wait and watch while the BJP explodes/implodes?

	- Interview with Yashwant Sinha
		- former minister of finance as part of BJP
		- currently with TMC
	- 2019 was a stolen verdict in terms of how BJP made governments in states
	- Pulwama was the only reason Modi won in 2019
	- #politics/strategy For 2024, points for opposition 
		- should not bother too much wwith "unity" in opposition because
			- overheads
			- media will question who will be PM candidate leading to more rifts
		- most voters focus on local issues
		- focus regionally with state-wise strategy
		- focus at booth level
		- figure out PM candidate after mandate
