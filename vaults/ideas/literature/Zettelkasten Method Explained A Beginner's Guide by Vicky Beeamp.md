Zettel means a piece of paper.
Kasten means a crate.

Fleeting notes can occur during/as:
- shower thoughts
- walking thoughts
- epiphany with friends

Literature notes:
- taken when consuming content likke articles, books, podcasts, movies, songs, etc.
- one atomic idea per note
	- no more than 3 to 5 sentences
- redescribe the idea in your own words which will help internalize it
- maintain web links or bibliographical references

Permanent notes:
- these are created by reviewing fleeting and literature notes
- one atomic idea per note
	- permanent notes should influence your gathered pieces of information such that:
		- they can build up other ideas and information sets
		- they can be rearranged as per your thoughts and perspectives
- they should be written assuming that the reader will have not context
	- apart from others, more importantly, this will help your current and your future self
- these should connect with other notes in your system; it is these connections that make your knowledge usable

How to set up kastens:
- reference box
	- literature notes
- ideas box
	- permanent notes

Fleeting notes are not categorized here. They go directly into your permanent notes.

This arrangement should never be used in a "top-down" manner where you first create categories like politics, technology, history, psychology, etc. and then add new notes to each category.
Intead, this should be viewed as a bottom-up approach where we make notes first and then see what grouping or lining can emerge.

This aids in Intersectional Thinking which is the idea that the intersections between ideas is where creativity and innovation thrives.

You might want to adapt the Zettelkasten system to the way you think:
- Approach 1: put all 3 types of notes into one box and use digital grouping or tagging
- Approach 2: arrange all kinds of notes chronologically
- Approach 3: arrange all notes spatially according to their type
