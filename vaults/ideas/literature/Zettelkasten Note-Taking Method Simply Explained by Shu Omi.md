# Zettelkasten Note-Taking Method Simply Explained by Shu Omi

What does Zettelkasten help with?
- build a web of knowledge
- find connections between topics
- retrieve the right memory
- develop ideas and arguments

Boxes used:
- reference box
	- reference details
	- brief notes about content
- main
	- ideas, theories, arguments, discussions, etc.

Literature Notes:
- these are taken when you are consuming literature
- these should be in your own words and copy pasted

Reference Notes:
- made when you have finished reading the piece of literature
- 2 sides:
	- reference information
	- brief note on the content
- these are kept in a bibliographical note section

Permanent Notes:
- these are the output of reviewing notes you have collected as literature notes
- how do the literature and fleeting notes relate to your existing interests, thinking, learning, research, etc?
- how will the new notes add value to your existing ideas, arguments, and discussions?
- is there a connection between what you have just learned and what you already know?
- the goal is not to collect as many notes as possible
- more information -> more hooks to connect information -> more cues to trigger the right memory

Questions to ask to find meaningful connections:
1. how does this idea fit in with what I already know?
2. can this be explained by something else?
3. what does X mean for Y?
4. how can I used this idea to explain something else?

Find keywords when making your notes such that:
- these keywords should be used more to retrieve information than to store it
- these keywords should be spotted by keeping an eye on topics you are working on or interested in, rather than looking at the new note in isolation
- Don't:
	- which keyword is most fitting for this note?
	- which category does this note fall into?
- Do:
	- in which circumstances do I want to stumble upon this note?
	- when and how will I use this idea?

When storing permanent notes:
- file a new note behind/along with a relevant note
- add links to this and all other relevant notes
- index and numbering to make discovery easier (applicable only to manual system)

Fleeting notes are mentioned as an extra step for notes not when consuming a piece of liuetrature but when an idea occurs in the real world. Review and convert them to permanent notes soon by going thru all the steps to tae them to a permanent note box (keywords, links, etc.)
