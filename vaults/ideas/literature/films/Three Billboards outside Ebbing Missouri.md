Director: 	Martin McDonagh
Cinematographer: Ben Davis
Editor: 	Jon Gregory

- victims and aggressors 
	- how their relationships change
- natural and incandescent lights from sources like red bulbs and neon signs
- role of media
	- effects
		- spreading rumours
		- triggering responses in people in private (individuals and families) and social (mobs) settings
- injustice done abroad is not considered worth investigating in their own country
- feels like a modern western
- feels like a Martin McDonagh film
	- had recently watched *The Banshees of Inisherin*
- The presence of African American folks is not as victims or saviours but as on-lookers. 
	- Like how the new Chief on-looks Dixon beating up Welby
- Sound design is good, probably not recreated during dubbing. 
	- As the chief's widow bangs the door behind her, the door sign rattles on the door making noise as it comes to rest.
- They probably did not go about and re-considered killing that soldier following the rule of law and not being vigilantes.
- The design of the signs in the film have been used as templates for signs in real life.
