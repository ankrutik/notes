- Phrasing happens over scales.
- Avoid phrasing that sounds like the scale being played up and down in a clean manner.
- Play in certain style/tempo
	- "Shuffle" for blues

## Phrasing Ideas
### Blues
- "Dirty" another note just before playing the note you want. 
	- Never use the root note to dirty.
	- In a Minor Pentatonic scale, use Flat third and Flat seventh
		- See "Scale degrees" of that scale to know these notes.
	- Use following options to dirty:
		- Vibrato
		- Up and down bends 
		- Slides
		- Hammer on and off
- Make phrases that will return back to the root note.
	- Consider this blues chord progression: A, A, D, A, E, D, A, E
	- During the bar of each of the above chords:
		- Use other notes to make the lick
		- But resolve each lick to the root note of the chord
	- Dirty a note just before you resolve to the root note

## Harmony
- Demnstration [How to SOLO on GUITAR | Part 2: Harmony - Scott Paul Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjH7x3-JZCI)
- When soloing over a chord (played in background), some notes feel weird even though they are part of the scale.
- Learn how to access notes in the scale that are part of the chord going by in the back.
- How do you know those notes are there? 
- Consider the Major pentatonic scale.
	- Major pentatonic in open position (nut) is in the key of G.
	- Hence it is considered to be a G shaped scale.
	- Consider notes in G Major scale. 
		- G Am Bm C D Em F
	- Remember this. Will use this later.
- Consider C major pentatonic.
	- Capo the first line of notes on the 8th Fret. Since C is on the 8th Fret of low E string.
	- Consider capo as nut and hold G chord shape. 
		- You may be holding a G chord shape but you are actually holding a C chord.
	- Consider capo as nut and hold C chord shape. 
		- You may be holding a C chord shape but you are actually holding a F chord.
	- These notes that you get by holding the shapes will give you the notes
- For chord playing in the background, what chord shape will I have to hold on the scale to get notes to that sound good with that chord?
	- The notes that will occur on that chord shape are the one I need to end my phrases with.
- Example 1. Consider root of C.
	- Major scale notes: C D E F G A B
	- Your rhythm guitarist chooses to play a 1, 4 chord progression
		- That is chords C and F
	- You choose to the major pentatonic scale to solo over. 
		- Maintain same root as rhythm, we choose C major pentatonic scale.
		- We know major pentatonic scale is G shaped.
		- In G major scale, 1, 4 will be G and C.
		- Solo strategy:
			- C chord, G chord shape
			- F chord, C chord shape
			- In other words, when C chord will be playing, end phrases with notes that fall on the G chord shape on the scale.
- Example 2. Consider root of A.
	- Major scale notes: A Bm C#m D E F#m
	- Your rhythm guitarist chooses to play a 1, 2 chord progression
		- That is chords A and Bm
	- You choose to the major pentatonic scale to solo over. 
		- Maintain same root as rhythm, we choose A major pentatonic scale.
		- We know major pentatonic scale is G shaped.
		- In G major scale, 1, 2 will be G and Am.
		- Solo strategy:
			- A chord, G chord shape
			- Bm chord, Am chord shape
			- In other words, when A chord will be playing, end phrases with notes that fall on the G chord shape on the scale.
- Minor pentatonic scale will be a Em chord shaped scale.
	- Because root of scale in open position falls on E note.
	- Also, G and Em are major-minor relative pairs.
	- Consider notes in E minor scale. 
		- Em F G Am Bm C D
- Example 3. Consider root of C minor.
	- Minor scale notes: C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb
	- Your rhythm guitarist chooses to play a 1, 4 chord progression
		- That is chords Cm and Fm
	- You choose to the minor pentatonic scale to solo over. 
		- Maintain same root as rhythm, we choose C minor pentatonic scale.
		- We know minor pentatonic scale is Em shaped.
		- In E minor scale, 1, 4 will be Em and Am.
		- Solo strategy:
			- Cm chord, Em chord shape
			- Fm chord, Am chord shape
			- In other words, when Cm chord will be playing, end phrases with notes that fall on the Em chord shape on the scale.
- Practice Harmony
	- Method 1
		- Arpeggiate on chord shapes.
		- Deliberately play other notes to see how they do not fit.
	- Method 2
		- End phrases on the chords.
	- Method 3
		- Start and end phrases on the chords.
	- Practice 4
		- Walk over scale. When you hit a note that fits, jump over next few notes to another notes that fits.
