- Phrasing happens over scales.
- Avoid phrasing that sounds like the scale being played up and down in a clean manner.
- Play in certain style/tempo
	- "Shuffle" for blues

## Phrasing Ideas
### Blues
- "Dirty" another note just before playing the note you want. 
	- Never use the root note to dirty.
	- In a Minor Pentatonic scale, use Flat third and Flat seventh
		- See "Scale degrees" of that scale to know these notes.
	- Use following options to dirty:
		- Vibrato
		- Up and down bends 
		- Slides
		- Hammer on and off
- Make phrases that will return back to the root note.
	- Consider this blues chord progression: A, A, D, A, E, D, A, E
	- During the bar of each of the above chords:
		- Use other notes to make the lick
		- But resolve each lick to the root note of the chord
	- Dirty a note just before you resolve to the root note
