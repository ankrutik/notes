# Making story feature videos
Tags: 

List down all aspects of the feature.
List down caveats. 
Create a story board on paper first. 

Clean data to show proper names of elements like persons, reports, etc. 

Consider making diagrams and tables to clarify or simplify information. 

When recording screen captures, apart from the subject itself, following points can add value:
- What hidden information can you show on the screen itself?
- What related information can you show that resides on another screen or image or document?
- Should you loop back to a previously shown element to bring the scene to close? Like when you want to prove a point. 

Maintain unified theme across video when using text overlays or chapters. 

> [!tip] Opinion on voice over
> If making feature videos is not part of your primary job and just something additional to programming, making text-only feature videos might be a quicker option than audio. The practice of watching video has changed from sitting in front of a TV to consuming videos in awkward places like in bed, bathroom, meeting rooms, commutes, etc where audio might not be an option. I prefer conveying information visually using text and graphics than speech. This overcomes problems of recording equipment, ambient/background noise, accents, diction, etc.
