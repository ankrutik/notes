# Houseplants

[toc]

- Nurseries have an optimum environment for growth of plant with respect to light, water, and humidity. When plants are brought home, they will take time to adjust to their new environment during which they may shed old leaves or show leggy growth for a couple of weeks or months. Nevertheless, they will stabilize.

# Requirements for house plants in descending order of importance

1. Light 
2. Water
3. Soil structure
4. soil nutrients
5. temperature
6. humidity

 # Light

Human eyes adjust to low or high amounts of light by increasing or decreasing sensitivity. Plants don't see light that way. For humans, a dark corner of a room may appear reasonably bright, but the same corner may be a slow death for a plant.

The best amount of light for a house plant is bright indirect light.

The best spot for a house plant is 

- as close as possible to a window 
- with a sheer white curtain blocking any direct sun

A plant will need

- an unobstructed view of the sky for as many hours as possible
- direct view of the sun as little hours as possible

Direct afternoon sunlight is bad for most tropical house plants, but necessary for plants that yeild vegetables and flowers.

The amount of light received at a point can be measured with "light meter" apps for most phones that use the ambient light meter on a phone. This light is measured in foot candles.

When purchasing a plant, you need to determine 2 things:

- where do you intend to place the plant in your house?
- does that spot have adequate light for your plant?

Some light ranges:

- 50-150 foot candles: a distant window on an afternoon; snake plant, pothos, philedendrons, zz plant

- 200-800 foot candles: your plant has a wide view of the sky or sunlight bouncing off a white curtain

- 800-1000 foot candles: sunny window blocked by a sheer curtain; maximum "bright indirect" light

- 8000+ foot candles: direct view of the sun; only cacti and succelents and large tropical plants may tolerate this much light

200 to 400 foot candles for as many hours as possible is adequate for good foliage growth.

When measuring light in your home, take measurements at around noon when the light is at its most.

Grow lights or other electrical lights may not give as many foot candles as the sky. Measure to see how much light a bulb or LED actually gives out. 

I've seen a warm light LED with 600 lumens output places at 4-5 feet to be adequate for most foliage plants. I use this area as a hospital for a plant that has been starved of light.

The more light a plant receives, the more water it will need.

If a plant is suddenly moved to a spot of substantially lower light, it may drop foliage to adjust to the new light.

# Soil

2 properties of soil that need to be balanced:

- water retaining: 
  - the soil should be able to hold on to water to make it available for the plant as and when it needs
  - too much retention can lead to stale soggy soil that can risk root rot, fungus, pests, etc.
- water draining:
  - the soil should be able to drain excess water out of the pot
  - too much drainage will lead to plants needing too much attention by wilting too often. However enthusiastic we may be at the start, we may not find time to water a plant that often

The most common type of soils available at nurseries are:

- clay: the usual red coloured soil that is sticky when wet and hard when dry. This is the cheapest for nurseries and should be avoided most of the time.
- garden soil: this is dark brown, black coloured which is not as bad as clay but can still become hard when dry.

Few problems that occur when soil in a pot goes hard after it has dried:

- Delicate roots of your plant may find it difficult to grow through this soil.
- Roots are deprived of air and oxygen.
- Soil may clump into a hard block around roots. When you water such a soil, water will simply flow along the edges and through the pot. Such uneven wetting of soil can starve your plant of water even though you seem to have watered it.

The best soil or substrate for house plants I've come across is a mixture of the following:

- coconut coir
- coconut chips
- compost
- perlite

This will have an adequate balance of water retaining and draining properties. This mixture does not go hard.

# Water

## When to water

Your plant will use up water proportional to the light it receives. If it receives less light, it will use water slowly. If it receives more light, it will use water quicker. The season affects this as well. So never have a routine of watering *every x days*.

Indicators of need for watering:

- Water only when the top 2 inches of the soil is completely dry to touch.
  - Do you feel that the soil will dry out tomorrow? 
    - If its a houseplant that thrives in moisture rich areas in nature, like ferns, then water today.
    - If its a usual tropical houseplant, then water tomorrow, not today.
    - If its a succulent or a plant with watery thick leaves (snake plant, zz plant), water in a few more days.
- Are the leaves of your plant drooping? Your plant is thirsty. Water it.
  - Observe your plant, it should perk up in ~2 hours. If it remains drooping, there is possibly root rot.

*If you are new to houseplants, enthusiasm will bias you towards the soil being dry even though it is wet. You will water too frequently and this zealousness will cost you root rot. You will then learn when the soil is dry.*

## Instruments

- A screw driver is preferred here, don't wait for an old one, get a new one dedicated for this.

- A goose neck watering can is prefered. 
- A dish
- Use filtered, drinking water for watering houseplants. You can never be sure about the chemical composition of tap water and the plant's sensitivity to chemicals.

## Aeration first

The most important step for watering is to aerate the soil first. Use a blunt chopstick or a screw driver to poke holes in the soil half or 1 inch away from the main stem. 

## Water like you're a barista

Assuming that the pot has a hole at the bottom, place the pot on a dish.

Water in a way that you make a spiral from the main stem to the edge of the pot, repeating once you reach the edge. Your aim is to saturate the whole pot till water starts flowing from the bottom.

## Discard the water, twice

Wait till all the water has drained. Discard the excess water collected in the dish. Do this check twice.

## How is the soil to touch?

After you have discarded the water and if you are using coconut coir as a substrate, the soil should have the consistency of a cake well moistened with sugar syrup. Not soggy, not dry. Evenly moistened.

## What these steps ensure

- your roots are getting oxygen due to the aeration
- any compactness of the soil is corrected due to the aeration
- the spiral watering will ensure that pot is evenly watered. You never know how the roots are growing inside the soil, so water reaches all the roots
- discarding the excess drained water will ensure that the roots are not sitting in stale, soggy soil and prevents root rot

# Routines and Checklists

## Every day

Look for any plants with drooping leaves. You plant should have perky, taut leaves that bounce back if you tap then gently.

Use a fine mist spray to spray your plants.

If soil appears dry, use your fingers to check the top 2 inches.

## Every 2 weeks

Look for plants that have the top part of the roots visible. Watering causes soil to leak out thru the drain hole hence dropping the soil level. Top up with some substrate.

Look for pots that have roots coming out the drain holes at the bottom. The plant has outgrown the pot. Tranfer the plant to a new pot one size larger. For example, if the current pot is 5 inches, move to 7 inches. 

Do not overestimate the pot size or upgrade to a larger one anticipating future growth. A pot that is too large will need more water to be evenly moist and the plant may not use all that water in time. This risks root rot. 

## When plants need Watering

1. Spot the pots that need water.

2. Start your water filter to fill up your watering can.

3. Get your screwdriver or chopstick. 

4. First pass. Go thru each identified pot:

   - avoid 1/2 to 1 inch from the main stem

   - poking holes all over

   - be careful if roots are tuberous or watery like ZZ plants have

5. Get your filled watering can.

6. Second pass. Go thru each aerated pot:

   - place a dish below the pot
   - water in spirals from the main stem to the edge of the pot, repeat
   - stop when water starts flowing out of the bottom hole
   - check if you need to refill your watering can

7. Get a small bucket.

8. Third pass. Go thru each watered pot:

   - empty the dishes into the bucket to get rid of the excess, drained water

9. Wait 15 minutes, appreciate your plants

10. Fourth pass. Go thru each watered pot:

    - empty the dishes into the bucket to get rid of the excess, drained water



Any drooping leaves should perk up after 2-3 hours. If they are still drooping:

- check if the soil has compacted and needs more aeration
  - if soil is well aerated and evenly watered, and your leaves still droop, you have root rot

## Trip to the nursery

- Has any of the plants out grown their pots? If yes,

  - what is the exact size of plant (one size up) that will be needed?
  - carry a measuring tape to buy the correct pot, most of the time the people at the nursery do not know the sizes

- Do you like a ceramic pot? If yes,

  - Do you have any plastic pots currently that will fit inside that pot?
    - if yes, does that plant look like it will overgrow that plastic pot?

- Do you like a plant? If yes,

  - do you have the space for this plant which will satisfy its lighting requirements?

  - check the roots of that specimen

    - any indication of root rot? the roots should be white and healthy

  - check the stem and under leaves

    - does it have any fungus or mites or bugs?

  - check the leaves

    - are they drooping?
    - are the top leaves burnt?
    - are the top leaves yellowing?

  - check the soil it is currently in

    - does it have fungal growth?
    - earthworms and centipedes are fine. 
    - does it have any bugs that look harmful to the plant?]
    - are there any slugs or snails?
    - does the soil look compacted or stale or soggy?

  - check the plant

    - does it look neglected and need of care? The plant is already in a nursery that should give it the optimum environment for growth. Bringing it home may or may not improve its health.

    - you may find it ugly but does it look healthy? if healthy, go for it.

    - ask the attendant about the plant's 

      - flowering season  
      - dormancy
      - lighting requirements

      You may be disappointed that the plant does not look a certain way after it has adjusted to your home.

    - insist on changing the soil to coconut coir or cocopeat

    - don't buy a smaller size plant thinking it will grow when you get it home. The nursery is an ideal environment for growth, the plant may not grow that fast at your home. Better to buy the size you want to enjoy it that way you want.

    - does the plant need any support like a stick? if so, ask the nursery to give one. You are unlikely to find a stick around your house.
