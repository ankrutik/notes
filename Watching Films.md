# Film
Art is subjective. The film makers had their point to make but **some of it will be left to the audience**.
Where is the film on a scale of **Realism vs Formalism**?
Is the **auteur theory** applicable?
What **historical/cultural context** is necessary? Does the film introduce any?
# Scene/Shot
Look closely to **describe** and ask why **deliberate choices** were made.
"**Mise en scene**" or "What is in the frame?"

# Story
Look at the events in the film from a macro level and describe them.

- What are the **main conflicts**?
- How are they **resolved**?

Observe, describe, simplify, ask why.

Repeat process to find more themes...
