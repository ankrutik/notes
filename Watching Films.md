# Film
Art is subjective. The film makers had their point to make but **some of it will be left to the audience**.
Where is the film on a scale of **Realism vs Formalism**?
Is the **auteur theory** applicable?
What **historical/cultural context** is necessary? Does the film introduce any?
# Scene/Shot
Look closely to **describe** and ask why **deliberate choices** were made.
"**Mise en scene**" or "What is in the frame?"
How are the **tools of cinema deployed**?
## Approach to scene
Where is the current scene or shot coming from?
How was the transition?
How much distance was covered in terms of...
- time
- physical space
- mood/emotions
Is tension added or conflicts resolved?
## Shot
- composition of the shot
	- aspect ratio
- subjective or objective perspective
- lens
	- focal length
	- height
	- texture
- set design
- lighting
	- where do our eyes go?
	- mood, atmosphere, reality
	- high/low key
- colours
- costumes
- realism vs abstract
- any other aspect that you can catch

## Scene
- Blocking (or how characters are positioned)
- Staging (or how is the camera positioned)
	- How does the camera move?
	- Energy of movement
- Intimacy of perspective
- Geography of scene

## Sound
What does the sound design add to the scene?
What is the music evoking?
Is the dialogue clear?

## Departure from scene

Tension or resolution?

# Story
Look at the events in the film from a macro level and describe them.
- How does it **start**?
- What **happens**?
- How does it **end**?
- What are the **main conflicts**?
- How are they **resolved**?
- How do the **characters change**?

Prototype your descriptions by simplifying them...
- from verbose, descriptive
- to succinct, thematic

Observe, describe, simplify, ask why.

Repeat process to find more themes...
- Gender
- Religion
- Sexuality
- Social Class
- Politics
