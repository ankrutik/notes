## Common assumed practices
- Chilled bloom
	- I used a chilled whiskey rock under the drip of the bloom pour
- Bloom timings
	- Restrict bloom close to 30 seconds instead of 45
	- Go above 40 seconds if visually obvious that bubbles are still forming and gas is releasing
	- 1 minute needed for some coffees
- Do not disturb coffee bed after bloom pour
- Melodrip
	- Melodrip is used for all pours after bloom.
	- Bloom is bare kettle
- Water at temperature for following uses outside of brewing
	- Rinse filter papers
	- Rinse and preheat serving cup or carafe
	- Rinse and preheat flask
- Grinder
	- Tilt grinder
	- Crank slowly
	- Blow away chaff
	- Mix grounds
		- Spin grounds inside grinder catch cup
		- Use WDT on catch cup
	- Wipe grinder **with a dry rag**
		- Pump air thru the burrs into the grinder chamber
		- Wipe the chamber from the other side
- 2 water spritz on beans
- WDT to level dry grounds inside filter paper
- Rinse brewer without soap as much as possible
## Parameters

	- Changing from 56 to 58 Red Clix for [[subko_salawara_bros]]

### Water
- $ Use Aquafina
	- Aquafina is currently better than Bisleri 
		- Temperature
- Mineral Composition
	- With dialling in [[standout_sookoo]], I might have to conceded that packaged drinking water/mineral water is better
	- When travelling, use packaged drinking water
		- Observed that Aquafina goes well 
	- Mumbai's water (filtered) is okay but not good enough
	- I think it affects the mouthfeel too, heavy creamy smooth.
### Ratio
- Use to adjust mouth feel more than taste
- See [[Bypass with Coffee]] to try out impact of various ratios
- By roast...
	- darker - tighter
	- lighter - wider
- Standards
	- Personal
		- Stick between 1:10 and 1:12
	- Community
		- 1:14-1:17, depending on roast level
		- Araku site says for pour overs start with 1:10 
- Three step approach...
	1. Adjust ratio for mouth feel
		1. Use [[Bypass with Coffee|separate cups]] where separate cup will have almost entire pour sizes. 
	2. Then tweak grind size if needed. 
	3. Then adjust ratio for taste
		1. Use [[Bypass with Coffee|separate cups]] where separate cups will have half of a pour size.
### Bloom
- Agitation
	- No agitation
	- WDT (Dry/Wet)
	- Swirl
		- Fines migration!
	- Wiggle
	- Excavate with Spoon
	- Probe with Melodrip glass stick
- Time
	- watch the bloom
	- you can stop once the bubbling stops
	- Standards
		- mostly around 35 to 40 seconds
- Chilled
### Pour
- Mix of bare kettle and Melodrip
	- Use Melodrip in later pours
	- [[Melodrip#When to use it...]] and [[Melodrip#When you might skip it...]]
- Wait before previous pour has drained?
	- Yes when you want increase extraction
	- No when you want to reduce extraction
- Height
- Speed
	- Vertical
	- Horizontal
- Pattern
- Number
- Agitation
	- Swirl 
		- [[Brewing by Coffee Processing#Washed Coffee Specifics|Swirling recommended for Washed Coffee]]
	- Wiggle
	- Tap
	- See [[Brewing by Coffee Processing#Impact of Processing on Agitation|Agitation by Processing]]
