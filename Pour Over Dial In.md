## Common assumed practices
- Chilled bloom
	- I used a chilled whiskey rock under the drip of the bloom pour
- 30 seconds bloom
	- Restrict bloom close to 30 seconds instead of 45
	- Go above 40 seconds if visually obvious that bubbles are still forming and gas is releasing
- Do not disturb coffee bed after bloom pour
- Melodrip
	- Melodrip is used for all pours after bloom.
	- Bloom is bare kettle
- Water at temperature for following uses outside of brewing
	- Rinse filter papers
	- Rinse and preheat serving cup or carafe
	- Rinse and preheat flask
- Grind
	- Tilt grinder
	- Crank slowly
	- Blow away chaff
	- Mix grounds
		- Spin grounds inside grinder catch cup
		- Use WDT on catch cup
- 2-3 water spritz on beans
- WDT to level dry grounds inside filter paper
- Rinse brewer without soap as much as possible

## Parameters
- Storage 
	- [[Resting or Degassing Coffee|Resting Period]]
	- Ambient Temperature
	- Frozen?
- Grind
	- Size
	- Speed
	- Angle of burr
	- Known standard starting points by processing
	- Changing from 55 red clix to 52 red clix took cup from slight bitter and dry to sweet and fruity with [[groundzero_eclipse]]
- [[Brewing by Coffee Processing|Impact of Coffee Processing on Brewing]]
- Water
	- $ Use Aquafina
		- Aquafina is currently better than Bisleri 
	- Mineral Composition
		- With dialling in [[standout_sookoo]], I might have to conceded that packaged drinking water/mineral water is better
		- When travelling, use packaged drinking water
			- Observed that Aquafina goes well 
		- Mumbai's water (filtered) is okay but not good enough
		- I think it affects the mouthfeel too, heavy creamy smooth.
	- Temperature
- Ratio
	- Use to adjust mouth feel more than taste
	- See [[Bypass with Coffee]] to try out impact of various ratios
	- By roast...
		- darker - tighter
		- lighter - wider
	- Standards
		- Personal
			- Stick between 1:10 and 1:12
		- Community
			- 1:14-1:17, depending on roast level
			- Araku site says for pour overs start with 1:10 
	- Three step approach...
		1. Adjust ratio for mouth feel
			1. Use [[Bypass with Coffee|separate cups]] where separate cup will have almost entire pour sizes. 
		2. Then tweak grind size if needed. 
		3. Then adjust ratio for taste
			1. Use [[Bypass with Coffee|separate cups]] where separate cups will have half of a pour size.
