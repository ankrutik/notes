Summary: 
Very nice performances with polished musicians in a very acoustically-well-designed venue

Details:
- 2 different performances, we didn‚Äôt know that
- Venue was very good, Tata Theatre at NCPA
	- Acoustically very very good
		- Piano, bass, jazz solos were very enjoyable
		- cheapest seats but very good amphitheater style view
- first was unconventional, modern jazz
	- piano, electric bass guitar, drums 
	- Cuban and Spanish musicians
	- Cuban and Spanish jazz without being Bossa Nova at all
	- Pati loved this one even though she was waiting for the next performance
		- Enjoyed the piano but loved the drums
	- Amazing interaction with audience
		- Adjusting to mobile phone ringing
		- Adjusting to people applauding or not reacting
	- jazz is all about how one makes a note dirty, that 80% of the motherfucker‚Äôs attitude
		- Never imaging how that can be done on a piano, wind instruments and guitar I can understand it can be done
		- This pianist bloody reached into the body of the piano and muted the notes with one hand and played the keys with another
			- Full on expression!
	- Pianist was mentored by Quincy Jones(producer for Micheal Jackson)
		- As a tribute, they did a Cuban Spanish jazz improv on Thriller
			- I was in tears, my god!!
- Second one was more conventional
	- Vocal jazz with a quintet
		- Singer, piano, double bass, drums, saxophone
	- Very good vocalist
	- Very good saxophonist 
	- Some originals, some classics from the American songbook
		- Pati cha favourite Honeysuckle Rose hota
- crowd
	- All age group except much Gen Z
	- All affluent NCPA member types mostly, responded well to jazz
	- Pati fit in well, I need to dress better
	- Old people and those with children started leaving in second performance which was bit insulting to the performers but a lot of people stayed back
	- NCPA is doing a good job making such performances relatively affordable
		- I guess mostly because they have their own venue which must be tax exempted
- Masta hota üëåüèº
