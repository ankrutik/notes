#history 

- notes from curatorial tour at CSVSM
	- Greek statues show perfect physique which was ideal and attributed to the divine. 
	- In real life, it was not how the population looked actually because of struggles due to famine, war, disease, etc. 
	- The imagery thru statues and paintings for to inspire the population to tend towards an ideal. 
	- Dionysus and apollo
		- balance of perfection and indulgence
	- Perfect depiction is often propaganda to showcase and scare cultures and populations that are the “other”
