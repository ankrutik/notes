# Shelf
In original bag, sealed. Not in kitchen. Store in cool dry place. A kitchen and its cabinets can get very hot and humid.

Dose out 3-4 brews worth in a smaller glass container which can be kept in freezer.

Use a temperature probe to know the actual ambient temperature of a place.
# Freezer
In original bag, sealed. Bag in an airtight container or zip-lock bag. All this in a freezer.

Dose out in glass jars and keep them in the freezer too.

Keep scale and dosing tray/bowl ready.
Open freezer, container, bag and dose out quickly.
Keeping it out for too long might introduce condensation whose water will freeze to ice in the bag.

## Condensation paranoia
In my own observations, you can transport such "frozen" beans and have them re-frozen at another place without much degradation in taste. Observed in Mumbai at the onset of monsoons.
Condensation might not be as bad as you think but still avoid.
