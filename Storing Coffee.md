# Shelf
In original bag, sealed. Store in cool dry place. 

Use a temperature probe to know the actual ambient temperature of a place.
**Not in kitchen.  A kitchen and its cabinets can get very hot and humid.**

For me, the bedroom wardrobe is best since that room will tend to be cooler.

Dose out 3-4 brews worth in a smaller glass container.

Update from using up [[groundzero eclipse]]. Beans stay fine without dosing and a wrapper zip lock bag if the bag is good enough. Just store away from a hot and humid area like my kitchen. Find the coolest room in your house. Wardrobe works perfect for me. 

## Actual Observations
Tested multiple imported coffee bags  stored in my bedroom wardrobe over the course of 1.5 months. Bags had resting times of 10 days to 21 days when I received them. These bags were used over 3 to 4 weeks. 
*There is no significant degradation in the aroma or flavour.* 

Any bags that I'm currently tired of at the end of 4 weeks, I will move to the freezer for a later date.

**There is no need to store fresh bags in the freezer.**

# Freezer
In original bag, sealed. Bag in an airtight container or zip-lock bag. All this in a freezer.

If you are going to use a frozen bag regularly over the next few days, dose out in glass jars and store the jars in the freezer.

Keep scale and dosing tray/bowl ready.
Open freezer, container, bag and dose out quickly.

Keeping it out for too long might introduce condensation whose water will freeze to ice in the bag.

## Condensation paranoia
In my own observations, you can transport such "frozen" beans and have them re-frozen at another place without much degradation in taste. Observed in Mumbai at the onset of monsoons.
Condensation might not be as bad as you think but still avoid.
