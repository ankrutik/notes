#notes 

Linear notes are hard to review even though formatted. 
We think in relational way (mind map).
Conventional note taking collects information, not knowledge. You are just gathering and shuffling in different formations.
This might not help understanding.
Especially true for notes taken in academic life.

Diligent note taking often leads to quitting because it gets too much.
Traditional notes antithetical to the way we think.

Instead we need a system where one idea connects to another idea.

Syntopical **reading** taken from "how to read a book".

Syntopicon: collection of topics

When reading...
- "hunt ideas"
- **tease out key idea
- **categorize**
  
When reviewing...
- contrast and compare similar ideas 
- from different sources
# Process
1. Find relevant passages that summarize
	1. Don't reword everything you read
	2. Look for one passage that captures the idea
2. Put that single passage in your own words
	1. unifying different authors' languages/tone into your own
3. Define themes
	1. tags and categories
	2. use intuition that is your own
4. Compare and contrast
	1. As syntopicon expands, you'll notice 
		1. conflicts
		2. different points of view
	2. Builds a wholistic view of the topic
5. Review blind spots
	1. Ask what is missing in your understanding of the topic
	2. What to read next
