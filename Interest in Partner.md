Your partner may not have the interest or reciprocity or time, patients and energy for your thoughts on our weekday or weekend. 

And thatâ€™s okay. No need to be disappointed.

Need regular vacations to completely switch off and spend that time, focus, patients and energy about what your partner wants. A conscious and deliberate switch.
