- Experience is not what happens to us but what we make of what happens to us
- What do we learn from the outcomes of decisions we take?
- If outcome depended completely on our decisions, skill was at play. 
- If outcome depended on things beyond our control, luck was at play. 
- In most cases, outcome will depend on a mix of skill and luck.

	- determine if any outcome was because of skill or luck 
	- If skill, then what can we learn for further decisions

	- we attribute good outcomes to our skills and bad outcomes to luck
		- Reverse when we observe others
