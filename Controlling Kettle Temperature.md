# On Stove
- Get an idea where the kettle thermometer (if any) reaches when the water approaches desired range of temperature. 
	- Kettle thermometers are often inaccurate or eventually lose accuracy. Knowing the rough positions of the needle will still keep it useful while you take readings with a digital thermometer. 
- Replace the kettle thermometer with a digital one and start reading. 
- When water approaches t-2 degrees, turn stove knob to lowest. Then cut off heat just as water passes desired temperature. 
- Take off stove. Water is not ready yet. 

# Off the stove 
- Place the kettle on a silicone mat. Kettle will lose heat slowly. 
- As you are ready to pour, take a reading with a digital thermometer again.
- If you want the water to cool further but at a faster rate, move the kettle from the silicone mat onto the kitchen counter. 
	- Heat will be lost in warming the kitchen counter. Temperature will drop faster. 
	- The warmed kitchen counter will eventually take up heat slowly. Move to another area on the kitchen counter to lose more heat faster. 
- Start pouring. Place the kettle on the silicone mat when taking a break between pours. 

# Why a silicone mat?
- Silicone mats are heat resistant, so they help retain heat. 
- Many have raise patterns on them, further minimising contact with the kettle. 
- When purchasing, look for “Silicone Trivet Mats”
