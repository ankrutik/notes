# First pass
Read it without much analysis or need to take notes. *Experience the matter as the author intended it.*

Occasionally, evaluate the quality of your reading. *Can you explain or even recall the last paragraph that you just read?*

> [!warning] 
> If thoughts of ideas or actions pop up, write them down for later and get back to reading. This is important because you'd never finish reading. Reading needs to be a conscious effort.

Make quick markings where you'd want to return. 
It's your own book, use a pencil or a pen. Ballpoint is better as it won't bleed thru the paper.

# Second pass
Choose to make:
- [[Literature Notes]]
	- Only if the article/book/film seems to be important enough to be recorded on its own
	- Pull out points to make consolidated, permanent notes in later passes.
	- For articles, use a single "Archive" note to list multiple articles together with tags
- [[Permanent Notes]]
	- Take snippets directly into permanent notes
- Mind-Maps
	- For technical or structural content 
	- *Do you want to visualize notes for decision making?*

Consider flagging notes for review later in a third pass.

# Third pass
Optional.

Go thru notes and see if you can do any of the following:
- Revise content
	- Bold certain keywords
	- Reword sentences to make them more succinct
	- Remove entire parts if they are redundant due to notes added later
- Tag for search
	- *What filter/search result should bring this note up?*
- Link for relations
	- *Will it help if this note popped up when looking at some other note?* 
- Pull out rules and format them as callouts or admonitions.

**Pull out sections to make consolidated permanent notes.**

Do you need to schedule spaced repetitions?

## Revision pass
Look at the markings in the book and read only those markings.

Open up the literature note and see outgoing links to all permanent notes.
