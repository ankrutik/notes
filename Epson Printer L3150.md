 - [[Epson Printer L3150#Nozzle Cleaning]]
	 - Banding on dark parts of prints
	 - Colours missing on print

# Nozzle Cleaning
- Print nozzle check sheet first
- Perform nozzle head clean up 
	- Perform 5 nozzle head cleanings at most
	- Allow 1-12 hours for the clean up to take effect

# Power Cleaning
- Use rarely as it will use up waste ink pads which need to be replaced

# Open Questions
- Advanced Epson printer settings has “thick paper” option. Can we use with 300gsm watercolour paper?
