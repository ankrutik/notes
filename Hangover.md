Wine and good quality guns are least affecting. 
Kahlua, Aperol, Absolut vodka, Stolichnaya vodka were found to be not causing hangover. 
Avoid everything else. 
Keep drinking a glass of water between drinks. 
Use a lemon when drinks are not appetising. 

In case of hangover
- check for acidity
	- Drink a vessel full of warm water and puke it out till the chest and neck feels lighter and devoid of sourness or acidity
- Drink a basic ORS: salt, sugar, water
- Sleep well
- Eat curd to help gut bacteria
- Okra/bhendi for fiber
