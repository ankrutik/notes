### Method  
1. Get 2 clean glass or ceramic cups that you drink from. Hot water. Swirl and throw. 
2. ⁠Consider Tetsu Kasuya's 4:6 recipe or a simple 5 pour. 
3. ⁠Pour the bloom and 3 pours (4 in total) in one cup
4. ⁠Switch brewer on to the other empty cup, tare, pour the last pour
5. ⁠Brew finished

Now smell both cups. Taste both cups. 

### Questions on the bypass cup
- How much of the second cup do you want in the first cup?
- How flavourful and strong (or not) is the second cup?
- Will the weakness of the second cup be detrimental to the first cup or will it add some sweetness or other character?

### How to use with changes to grind size
Every time you change grind size, use these separate extractions to understand how the extraction distribution turns out.
You can then pin point how much of the last pour you want in the overall cup.

- If second cup is sour...
	- Grind size is too coarse
		- Reduce grind size
	- or Ratio is too less
		- Increase brew water
- If second cup is bitter...
	- Grind size is too fine
		- Coarsen grind size
	- or Ratio is too much
		- Reduce brew water
- If too watery... **(yet to test)**
	- Increase agitation?
	- Increase temperature?
