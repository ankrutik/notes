# Self Learnings in Watercolour

- When using tubes, extract all colours in the wells of a palette in the order that is shown on the box.
	- When using colour, do not muddle the wells with other colours. 
	- Always clean the brush before using colour from the wells. 
	- Take the colour from the well and mix it in the open area on the palette.
- Use a small, **folded Turkish towel to drain water off a brush** that has been cleaned. Do not use a tissue paper to dry a brush, you'll waste too much paper. A towel can be washed and reused.
- Use a **tissue to wipe a palette** when you have run out of place to mix colours. You can let that tissue dry completely and reuse it.
- To dry a brush on the towel, simply drag it along the length of the towel while twirling it. The brush will be dried and a point will be created. Helps preserve the shape of the bristles.
- The Chinese White can be used to apply highlights on completely dried washes. This works to a certain extent but results are decent. You will need to take thick colour straight out of the well without much water.
- The colours straight off the tube or pan are not naturally occurring. Force yourself to use study and use mixes to achieve more natural hues.
