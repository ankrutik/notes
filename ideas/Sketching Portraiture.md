## General routine
- Start with a circle for head

	- eye socket
	- nose parts
	- cheeks
	- lips
	- chin
	- flesh that connects cheeks and chin
- check alignment of
	- nose with eyes and ears
	- silhoutte of face
- Observe your subject from viscerocranium anatomy perspective to observe and mark features better.
- Fill out with pen
	- Start with eye brows
	- How big or small is the nose?
	- See how lips sit with each other
	- Dotted lines for wrinkles
- Leave shading and 3 dimensionality of features to watercolour

## Eyes
- Observe eye sockets to get a sense of depth of the area around the eyes 
	- how do they sit on the face?
- Draw a very faint outline of the eye sockets and then place the eyes in a relative position to the eye socket.
- During painting, the eye socket may need a darker tone than the rest of the face.
