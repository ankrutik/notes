- things that went against watching the film 
	- we reached late, missed the scene where Aadam watches Nooran's singing and longs for her 
	- no English subtitles, Rajasthani language was too dense for us to understand. Pratiksha and I understood separate fragments of the dialogue and had to exchange notes later. 
- probably the best filmed kissing scene I have ever watched 
- movement of camera creates an interesting sense of involvement with that world 
- lighting creates a dreamy effect, we're in the desert but it seems like it's overcast all the time 
- feels more Arabian nights than Rajasthan 
- Irfan Khan's last theatrical release, but as Pratiksha fact checked me, he was not diagnosed with cancer as he worked on this film. Original release was 2017.
