# Don't Worry Darling (2022)
Tags: #film/notes 
Director: Olivia Wilde, 2022
Cinematographer: Matthew Libatique 
Editor: Affonso Gon√ßalves 

Felt like a 7.2 IMDB rating film. Could have done better. Felt more like a series on HBO could have done more justice but they already have Westworld.

Great acting by Florence Pugh.

At first, seemed like too much sex without adding value to the plot. But this was reflection of the fantasy of the males who had trapped their partners in this simulation. One of the same males, Harry Style, in real life is shown to be unkept like a hobo.

The houses are shown to be arranged in a spiral fashion.

The earth shaking blasts add no value to the film. If what the men do was meant to be kept secret, the blast should not have been part of the simulation.

The appearance of red plane adds no value to the film other than an observed anomaly. Was someone forcing that anomaly to make certain people question? Was it a glitch? Not answered like the earthquake.

Watched on 20221002 at PVR Dynamic Juhu. Mubi Go.
