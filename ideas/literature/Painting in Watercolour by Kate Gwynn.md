# Painting in Watercolour by Kate Gwynn

## Atmospheric Perspective
Atmospheric perspective is a way to show depth in a painting by showing the effect of the atmosphere on objects in the fore, mid, and background.

Objects in foreground will retain their details,  colour, tonal values in full. Object farther away will have the same properties modified.

The level of modification of these properties shows how thick the atmosphere can be.

## Measuring
When starting to sketch, choose a position to sit such that you will not be disturbed for at least 10 minutes. Do not change your position.

The Human eye may have 180 degrees vision but only 45 degrees is in focus. Be aware of this and choose to keep your entire scene in this field of vision.

## Color Theory
Hue described the colour itself.

Tone is the brightness or darkness of the colour.

When deciding tone:
- squint eyes to see brightness value
- is the colour?
	- warm
	- cool
	- brilliant
	- dull
	- acid
- what other colour is seen with this colour

## Washes
Dampen paper entirely. Use brush full with colour. Do not lift midway between strokes.

### Flat Wash
Keep uniform. Wash may appear inconsistent when wet, wait for it to dry.

### Graded Wash
Add or reduce water on brush as you keep moving along the gradient.
