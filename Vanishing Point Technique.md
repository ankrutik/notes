- Use to determine correct speed around turns
- On turns, the left and right edges of the road converge onto a point in the distance. This is the Vanishing Point.
- When going around a turn, if the vanishing point is getting
	- closer to you, you need to slow down
	- father from you, you can speed up
- Helpful also because it makes you focus at a distance. You spot things earlier on the road.
