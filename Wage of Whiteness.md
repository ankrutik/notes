> The concept of “wage of whiteness” was used by DuBois to indicate the difference in the social position of blacks and whites in America. The poor whites still are better off than poor blacks, if not economically, but socially in American society. They did not have to face the Jim Crow laws of segregation from public parks to transportation. DuBois argued that they enjoyed a wage of whiteness. The very fact that they were not black, made them citizens with rights.
