## Purpose 
To let CO2 escape out of the coffee on its own.
You will still need to keep the coffee in a closed container or bag with a valve otherwise oxidation will be much more. 

Filter brewing methods will need less resting as you can bloom to let the coffee release CO2. Espresso pucks are a closed environment so need longer resting time.
## **Dark roasts**
Use as fresh as possible since it starts to oxidise and the acidity increases after about a week.
## **Medium roasts**
Usually lasts for a month or two before flavours deteriorate.
e.g. Araku Grand Reserve started off tasting mediocre but much better after around 15 days. 
Tulum Baarbara HSD Medium Dark, 12 days
## **Light roasts**
Can last for much longer without losing flavour or aroma.
