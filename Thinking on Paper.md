#notes #thinking

Idea is to use paper and pen as a thinking device. An extension of your working memory and cognition space to spill onto a paper. 
See [[literature/The Notebook A History of Thinking on Paper by Roland Allen]], chapters 30 and conclusion.

> [!warning]
> **Not to be confused with the general practice of taking notes.**

Use a "Commonplace/Field" notebook (see [[Paper Notebooks]]) instead of random pieces of paper.
