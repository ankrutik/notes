The Melodrip essentially acts as a "shower screen" for pour-over, distributing water more evenly across the bed. It's particularly valuable when working with challenging beans or when you want maximum control over your extraction, but it's not necessary for every V60 brew.
## When to use it...
- **Even extraction with difficult beans** - Light roasts, dense beans, or uneven grinds that tend to channel or extract unevenly
- **Controlling agitation** - When you want minimal turbulence to prevent over-extraction of fines or delicate flavors
- **Consistent pour control** - If you struggle with steady, controlled pours directly from a kettle
- **Highlighting clarity** - When you want to emphasize clean, bright flavors and reduce muddiness
- **Experimental brewing** - Testing different flow rates and dispersion patterns

## When you might skip it...
- **Standard medium roasts** - Well-developed beans that extract evenly often don't need the extra dispersion
- **When you want more body** - The Melodrip tends to produce cleaner, lighter-bodied cups
- **Speed brewing** - It adds time to your brew process
- **If your pouring technique is already consistent** - Experienced pourers may not see dramatic improvements
