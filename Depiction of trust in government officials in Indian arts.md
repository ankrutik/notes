#politics 

Noticed this in Aakar Patel’s book After Messiah and in Anubhav Sinha’s film Anek. 

The politicians are the problem whereas the administration, be it the civil service of judiciary, are shown as heroes or righteous in a hesitant manner. 

Great hope and expectation is put on the administration whereas they might be the ones who must be enabling the politicians.
