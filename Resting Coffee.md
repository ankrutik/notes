- Dark roast: 
	- as fresh as possible, around 1-3 days coffee resting is sufficient. 
	- Starts to oxidise and the acidity increases after about a week.
- ﻿﻿Medium roast: 
	- at least 7-10 days, 
	- usually lasts for a month or two before flavours deteriorate
	- e.g. Araku Grand Reserve started testing very different but better after around 15 days
- ﻿﻿Light roast: 
	- between 10 - 14 days, 
	- the coffee can last for much longer without losing flavour or aroma
