The purpose of resting coffee is to let CO2 escape out of the coffee on its own.
You will still need to keep the coffee in a close container or bag with a valve.

Filter brewing methods will need less resting as you can bloom to let the coffee release CO2. Espresso pucks are a closed environment so need longer resting time.

- Dark roast
	- For filter
		- 2 days
	- For espresso
		- 1-3 days
	- Use as fresh as possible since it starts to oxidise and the acidity increases after about a week.
- ﻿﻿Medium roast
	- For filter
		- 3-4 days
	- For espresso
		- at least 7-10 days, 
	- usually lasts for a month or two before flavours deteriorate
	- e.g. Araku Grand Reserve started testing very different but better after around 15 days
- ﻿﻿Light roast
	- For filter
		- 5 days
		- 10 days for very light
	- For espresso
		- between 10 - 14 days, 
	- the coffee can last for much longer without losing flavour or aroma
