# Self Learning in Sketching
Tags: #learning #art #sketching 

- Observe
	- curves might not be true curves and just a sequence of lines
- Outline with a 2B pencil
	- use a grip that is farther away from the point, closer to the middle
	- draw major shapes even if they are a subset of a larger part
	- pay attention to proportion at this stage
		- proportions should be done dynamically by comparing parts that may not look obviously comparable
		- use triangulation with other parts to position new parts
- Trust your outlines and do detailing with a pigment liner
- Perspective
	- Check horizon line
	- then establish vanishing point
	- all perspective will be in relation to these 2 concepts, trace lines from outside of paper to get an idea of angles that lines should take
