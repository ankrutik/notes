# Simple answers over complex explanations
Tags: #mental-models

People tend to accept and propagate simple solutions/answers over complex nuanced ones even if they are wrong. 

This perception is often taken advantage of in politics. 

A defense used for this will be Ocham's Razor. But Ocham's Razor states the simpler of the correct and evidence based solutions should be chosen. Prerequisite being all solutions should be correct. So in my opinion, Ocham's Razor cannot be used.

[PFI gets banned](https://twitter.com/SitaramYechury/status/1575051030110564352)
The view is that PFI is an extremist organization but the banning of the same might not be constitutional if there were no grounds to do that same. 
- Banning an organization with extremist views might be a simple solution
- But verifying the constitutional validity in terms of freedom of speech and grounds of the ban is a complex solution.
