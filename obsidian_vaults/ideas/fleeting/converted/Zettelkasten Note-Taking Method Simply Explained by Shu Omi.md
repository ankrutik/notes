# Zettelkasten Note-Taking Method Simply Explained by Shu Omi

 what diudd it help with:
 - build a web of knowledge
 - find connections between topics
 - retrieve the right memory
 - develop iddeas an arguments

*Not sure at thhis point how the linking an retrieving works with this method. may be tags?*

boxes:
- reference
	- reference detail
	- brief notes about content
- main
	- ideas, theories, arguments, discussions

literature notes:
- take these at the same time as you are consuming the literature
-  in your wown word, no copy pasting

*Here, things are deviating from what i have understood. I unerstoo that you can copy paste while you are reaing and keep them in fleeting notes. But when reading, you should be directly making literautre notes. Maybe it would ddiffer accorddin g to circumstance. When I o not have the time to make notes in my own words, I can just copy paste into fleeting notes and then trasfer them into literature notes. This is so that we do not lose the benefit of internalizing in your own words.*

reference note:
- done when you have finished reading
- one side has reference information
- other side has brief note about the content
- keep these notes in a bibliographical card

permanent notes:
- review the notes you have collected previously
- how do these new notes relate to your interests, thinking, learning, research
- the goal is not collect as many notes as you can but to kkknow how the new notes adds value to your existing ideas, arguments, and discussions
- connection between what you just learned and what you already know
- more information -> more hooks to connect information to -> more cues to trigger the right memory

finding meaningful connections:
1. how does this idea fit in with what I already know?
2. can this be explained by something else?
3. what does X mean for Y?
4. how can I use this idea to explain something else?

find keywords when making notes. this is used more to retrieve notes than to store them.
keep an eye on the topics you are working on or interested in. never by lookking at the notes in isolation.

*look at the graph map for coming up with these keywords*

don't:
- which keyword is most fiutting for this note?
- which category does this note fall into?
do:
- in which circumstance do I want to stumble upon this note?
- when and how will I use this idea?

when storing to permanent notes:
- file new note behind a relevant note
- add links to all relevant notes
- index to make discovery easier

fleeting notes are mentioned as a extra step when you are not reading but come across ideas in the real world. review and convert them to permanent notes soon. 
*When I use the word convert in the above sentence, I mean go thru all the steps to put an idea into a permanent note box.*

*Author uses roam reserach. The videos linked at the end of videos is an exmaple of creating such links.*
