## how luhmann did it

fleeting notes:
- shower thoughts
- walkkking thoughts
- epiphany with friends

literature:
- consuming content likke artivcles, bookks, poddcasts, movies, songs
- capture one atomic idea per note. no more than 3-5 sentences each.
- redescribed in your own word, so you internalize
- references maintained

permanent:
- create by **reviewing** fleeting and literature notes
- one atomic idea per note
	- building up and rearragning
- write assuming that the reader has no context
	- future proof even for yourself
- connect with other notes in the system'
	- connections make your knowledge usable

How to setup kastens:
- references
	- literature
- ideas
	- permanent

fleeting notes not categorized. Need to review regularly to make them permanent.

This is not a top down approach where we first makkkke a group like politics, technology, socialogy, psychology and then put notes in them. Instad this is a bottom up approach where we firstly takke notes andd then see what grouping and linkl can happen.

intersectional thinking or the intersection between ideas is where creativity and innovation takes place.

You might want to adapt the zettelkasten system to the way you think:
- put all types notes in one box and let digitization to the sorting
- arrange notes chronologically
- arrange spatially as separate groupings of fleeting, literature, permanent
