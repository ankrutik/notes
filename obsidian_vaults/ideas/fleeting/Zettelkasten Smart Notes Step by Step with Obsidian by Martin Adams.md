Differences between fleeting notes and literature notes:

| fleeting notes | literature notes |
|----|----|
|  copy paste content as-is from article or video | your own interpretation and thoughts |
|  can be random thoughs | should link to piece of literature like articles, books, videos, lectures, etc. |

permanent notes:
- build, insert, update over time
-  default place for creating new notes: sama folder as current file
	-  this is needed for creating symlinks when creating links within notes
-  permanent notes do not relate to a specific piece of literature but is related to the universal topics in those pieces of literature
-  you start out with a "map of contents", like an index
-  then you add topics to the MOC
-  for that topic in the MOC,  you then create 
	-  a separate new note; Ctrl+Click; then pull a template into this new file if you want
	-  or link in sections from other notes for that topic in the MOC

Links
- you can create empty links and then create actual notes on it by Ctrl+Clicking that link
- or you can link existing notes or URLs to links
- Permanent notes will have links to related literature notes
- Literature notes will have links to the actual source oif infoirmation and fleeting notes
- Fleeting notes will have link to the original source of information

Obsidian allows to see notes and their links as map/graph.

Use links with exclamation mark in front for the renderer to pull the content of that note link into the preview. Then open up a source code - preview style pane and start composing a draft on the left hand side.
