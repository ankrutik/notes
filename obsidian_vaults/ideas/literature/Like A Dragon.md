Good observation of [[Majoritarian Politics]].

So many twists and turns. This story is overwhelmingly positive. All of the chapters are gold. 

The turn based combat doesn't feel like restricted. It's close to the quickness of usual combat but with inputs for elaborate attacks. The graphics and effects keeps things entertaining. 

During turn based combat games, it's important to heal as well. So much so that during one entire rounds of input, you will only do maintenances like healing, debuffing, buffing, reviving, etc. 

Look for mechanics in the game that helps you progress. 

Progress boosting mechanics:
- Business management to earn huge amounts of cash quick
- A charm that disables enemies when free roaming
- Dungeons that help grinding
- Sub-stories that give items, experience, poundmates

Other mini-games are interesting enough on their own to play as party games. 

Kiryu was the first boss in the game that forced us to think about the weaknesses of the enemy. In his case, burning. That's when I used Nanba again. The point of his fight with Kasuga was to subside Kasuga's rage and force him to think. In a way, Kiryu does that to the player as well. 

Kiryu's cameo was so meaningful.
