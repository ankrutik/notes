# How 'Idgah Maidan' became Karnatakaâ€™s mini-Ayodhya
Tags: #politics 

In the current 2022 Ganpati festival issue, there are 2 Idgah maidans. 
Idgah maidans are where Muslims offer prayer en mass. 
Such a maidan in Hubli was given on lease to Anjuman-e-Islam for 999 years by the Municipality for use for prayers twice a year apart from which it will be used as a playground and for fairs. 
The BJP, riding on the Ayodhya fame, tried to hoist a flag which the AeI opposed on legal grounds of being a private property. 
The Congress government sided with the AeI. The SC passed a ruling to stay demolition on a building built on that ground. 
The BJP used this legal status to create a simplified half truth by calling the AeI as people who have a problem with hoisting the national flag. 
The party seems to revel in such "simple but wrong" judgements. https://twitter.com/MichaelWarbur17/status/1566098853392171008?t=KhNwbrT5BQQqqrE1v_X1uA&s=19
Their elected MLAs jumped from 4 to 40 in that time period and was this was the BJP's in roads into Karnataka in the 90s.
