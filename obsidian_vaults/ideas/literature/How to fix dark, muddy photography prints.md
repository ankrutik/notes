- print is different than screen
	- screens are backlit
	- paper is lit by ambient light
- Use colour neutral light on print to see if you are actually loosing detail
	- if not, fix viewing conditions (?!)
- lower brightness of display, turn off auto-brightness
	- matte displays over glossy
	- hold sheet of paper next to screen to get same ball park brightness
	- expensive option is to use a display caliberator
- type of papers
	- reflective: gloss, semi-glossy, metallic
		- tonal range similar to screen
	- non-reflective paper: matte, rag
		- lower tonal range
- Photo edit software preview is not how image will look like in print
	- use "soft proofing" preview (hard proof is your print)
	- check ICC profile for your printer and paper
	- "perceptual" does good with low key images
	- enable "simulate paper and ink"
- Dark values
	- create proof copy and edit that image for print
	- black point compensation will squeeze values in tonal range of printer
	- options
		- use tone curve to lift values
		- open up "shadows" region
		- luminance tone mask to lift only certain tones
