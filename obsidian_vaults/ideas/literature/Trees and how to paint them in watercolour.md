# Trees and how to paint them in watercolour
Tags: #watercolour 

Traits needed:
- freedom of handling:
	- sureness of the brush
	- comes from practice and knowledge
- lightness of touch

Draw form first.

Tools for the study sketch:
- Indian ink flows better
- Bristol board preserves a nice flat surface to work on
- broad nib pen

Get the proportions right.

Use pencil marks sparingly.

When applying a second wash:
- If a certain part is clearly well-defined, wait for the wash to try before applying tone for that part. 
- If that part merges into the wash, you can apply the tone before the wash goes dry.

brightest green: Antwerp blue, gambol
darkest green: Antwerp blue, raw sienna
pleasant greens: cobalt and raw sienna; cobalt and yellow ochre; varied with touches of burnt sienna, indian yellow, black, vandyke brown

## Approach
1. Draw a rough outline and structure with a light pencil.
2. Draw leaves in the strongest light first.
	1. Round size 8 brush, **brought to a pointed tip**. 
	2. Dab little leaves for outline, draw mass. Detached sprays of foliage.
3. After it has dried, draw branches and twigs. Connect detached spray of foliage. 
	1. Shadow on lower side of branches and where the branch disappears into the foliage.
4. After branches have dried, go about the darker parts. 
	1. Mass Foliage in some places, details in others. Similarly dab little leaves.

## Overall Approach
Do not pursue painting part that are not visible due to overlap. Continue the part where it reappears after the overlap.

Keep the mass of the tree and void cutting it with too much detail. Especially in the center.

If the work looks alright at the second wash, leave it. Apply a third layer only if needed.

Attempt to show branches and foliage that is in the direction towards to the viewer.

Plan for highlights. If you want to apply after a wash, lift off the colour or use Chinese white.
