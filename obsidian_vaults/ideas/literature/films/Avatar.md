Director: James Cameron, 2009
Cinematographer: Mauro Fiore
Editor: James Cameron, John Refoua, Stephen E. Rivkin 

Theme of American capitalism taking over countries and their culture/politics via the military machine.

You appreciate the film more than 10 years later when all the CGI foliage looks so realistic.

Contrast of the military and scientific personnel. And where corporate sites among them.

The large branches of the trees are like platforms for the dwellers. Reminds of the level in Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order where you climb the large tree to reach the large bird.

Watched the re-release on 20221003 at PVR Dynamic Juhu in 3D, Atmos. Mubi Go.
