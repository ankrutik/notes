- Great sound design
	- The echo of gun shots
	- Drum beat to give sparse accentuation
- Production design
	- Makes you wonder how big a studio Netflix is, who funds these things
	- Amazing level of details in the trenches 
	- Large cinematic battlefields 
- Camera work
	- Amazing atmospheric shots of flares, night time
	- Watch this film with the correct colour reproduction in a dark room
	- Camera is facing gunshots which makes you a sitting duck
	- Colour pallet of the battlefield scenes
		- Beautiful colours on the horizon set the mood. Like a graded filter used in front of the lens. 
- Edit
	- Transitions and establishing scenes are very nicely done. 
	- Use of cuts in edit between scenes are not wasted. Used in a deliberate way to show contrast. 
- Heinrick is used and discarded from memory and replaced with another
	- Clothes washed, tags taken off, and reused casually
- The kids are so eager simply because the oratory and propaganda
	- Makes them seem powerful and Paris is achievable
		- The kids seem full of power, excitement, and a touch of evil.
	- Social status and trend is important to each other
	- Seniors, like their captains, seem to be cool but are just using these kids
	- Completely reversed when they see the realities and lies given to them
- Hell created on earth by men by putting their machinations in play of  chaos
- When they go back home and criticise the war, no one will believe them  Because it's honourable at home. 
- Theme of identity of soldier. Just tools and statistics. 
- Soldiers have all the desires of men, food and women. 
	- Problems like saving up money.
	- Family sick at home.
	- Loss of family.
	- Bad teeth.
	- Mid-fight breakfast 
- Kropp is getting delusional about women. 
	- He even starts thinking of the illustration in the poster as a girl back home
- "Germany will soon be empty".
- Cinema in Europe is warning against wars. This level of production for a war film. 
- Contrast between soldiers and diplomats.
	- Both are shown walking in lines.
	- One class of people is out for each other's blood due to orders. The other is not. Life is cheaper for the earlier. 
- Meeting and negotiation between diplomats 
	- in a train on neutral ground
	- French have an upper hand on the field and the negotiations 
	- Humiliation of the Germans, which is later picked up by Hitler 
	- Contrast of clean trains 
- Stillness between battle and skirmishes shown thru the still dead 
- Details
	- Discs from their necks are like Dog tags. One half goes for the count, the other half remains on the bodies to identify them.
		- They stop count purposely to show lower casualties.
	- close quarter combat in trenches using rifles 
	- First use of tanks?
	- Use of grenades in tanks 
	- Flamethrowers 
- German general on the balcony seeing war on the horizon with soldiers marching in the compound. Illusion of order and control. 
- Projectile blast throws hero up. Surreal, muffled sound. 
- Honour is only for the very few that survived. The dead don't feel any honour. War is an extreme expense only for the benefit of the few. 
- Hand to hand combat gets fatigued. Acting. 
- Like cyber-psychosis is shown in Cyberpunk can some psychosis affect these soldiers due to prolonged combat. Due to feeling of power due to easy killings. 
- Hero tries to help enemy soldier he just stabbed. Late peace is futile. 
- Film shows intimate and true lessons of war using symbolism thru incidents.
