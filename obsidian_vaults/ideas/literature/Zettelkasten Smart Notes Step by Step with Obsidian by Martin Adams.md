# Zettelkasten Smart Notes Step by Step with Obsidian by Martin Adams

[TOC]
## What does Obsidian provide
A way to create folders for ifferent types of notes.
Allows to see notes and their links as a map/graph.
See gaps in our understanding of the topic.


### Settings
Inside Core plugins, enable templates.
Default place for creating new notes: Same folder as current file
	-  this is needed for creating symlinks when creating links within notes

### Templates
You need to nominate a folder where you will store templates.
Templates are a quick way to fill up the structure or boiler-plate of notes.
These can be individual notes or map of contents.
Templates are used not as copies of the notes but as the content of the template pulled into an existing file.

### Workflows in Obsidian
Create a new fleeting note for each article, video, book that you feel like taking notes for.
Add a reference to the original source at the end.
While reading the article, copy pate notes as is or in your own words int he fleeting notes.

After completing the reading and the fleeting note, create a literature note foir the same source of information.

Use split view for moving things from fleeting notes to literature notes.

Idea for creating articles: Use `!` in front of links to expand their content into existing notes when viewing in reading mode. Open up note in edit pane on left and reading mode on right. Then start drafting the article on the LHS by looking at the expanded content on the RHS. After you are done, remove the `!` to clean up.
 
 ### Links
 You can create empty links first and then create actual notes to those links by ctrl+clicking that empty link.
 You can also create links to existing notes.
 Use `!` in front of links to expandd content of linkks into current note when viewing in reading mode.


## Fleetings Notes
Ideas, things we see on the web, quick ideas.
These can be copy pastes.
These should not be corrected for typos or formatting.

## Literature Notes
These can come from various sources like articles, videos, books, lectures, etc.
These need to be in our own words. This forces us to gauge our understanding of the topic.

## Permanent Notes
These are synonymous to slip box entries.
Allows us to ask questions against the entries.
Permanent notes build up over time through inserting new learnings or editing and correcting existing learnings.
These are note related to a spoecific piece of literature but relates to universal topics and subtopics.
You usually start out with a "Map of Contents" or an Index to the various subtopics of a larger topic. This allows you to have a unified view of all the permanent notes you have on that larger topic.
For each topic in the MOC, you can:
- create a seprate note and then pull a template into this new note
- link existing sections from other notes into the MOC

## Differences between
| Criteria | Fleeting Notes | Literature Notes | Permanent Notes | 
|--|--|--|--|
|Content|can be a copy-paste from the information source or your own notes|has to be your interpretation or explaination in your own words|has to be your interpretation or explaination in your own words|
|Sources|Can be an external source or your own thoughts|should always be related to an external source|should be a summary or collation of  information gathered from various literature sources|
|Links contained|to original source|to original source and fleeting notes|to literature notes|
