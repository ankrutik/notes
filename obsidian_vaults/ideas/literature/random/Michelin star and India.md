# Michelin star and India
Tags: #travel 

- For a restaurant in any country to have a Michelin star, the country itself needs to have a Michelin guide first. For example:
	- Australia does not have a Michelin guide, hence no Michelin star restaurants. 
	- Thailand has a Michelin guide, so even street vendors are mentioned on the Michelin guide. 
- India does not have a Michelin star guide hence India will not have any Michelin star restaurants. Just because of the absence of the guide and not because restaurants in India are not good.
- In some regions, other reviewers are more important than Michelin. For example, 
	- New York Times restaurant reviews have known to make or break restaurants and are more valuable than Michelin stars.
	- [World Top 50 List](https://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50) have had mentions of restaurants in India
