# Introductory chapters

Objectives
- what is to be achieved, no more, no less
- significant, concrete, action oriented, inspirational (?)
- should help against fuzzy thinking and execution

Key Results
- benchmark and monitor how to get to that objective
	- lever your pull, marks you hit to achieve goals
- time bound 
- aggressive yet realistic
	- If you are certain you are going to hit the KR, you might not be pushing enough.
- measurable and verifiable
- met or not at all, no gray area
	- at a designated period, mostly a quarter, the KR is declared to be met or not
	- when a KR is meant for a longer period like a year, the KR itself keeps evolving
	- when OKRs are not met, they are probably not designed properly
- 3 to 5 objectives are adequate to reach the KR. More than that can dilute the focus.

Problems with traditional Goals:
- narrow focus
- unethical behaviour
- increased risk taking
- decreased cooperation
- decreased motivation

# Superpower #1: Focus and commit to priorities
Focus on and commit to handful of initiatives that can make a difference. Defer less urgent ones. No one company/individual can do it all.

Wrong decisions can be corrected once results start to come. Non-decisions or hastily abandoned decisions teach us nothing.

If you do not model it, no one will do it.

Top line goals must be clearly explained with the why and what, instead of just revealing them. People want to understand how their goals relate to the mission.

Dual cadence with short term OKRs and a long term strategy.
Clear cut time frames to intensify focus and commitment and curb procrastination.

For feedback to be effective, it must received soon after the activity occurs.

OKR cadence should match company culture and context.

More ambitious an OKR, more the chance of missing a vital criterion. To safeguard quality, pair KRs with effect and counter-effect.

OKR can be scraped or changed any time during its cycle. Sometimes the "right" key results show up after some time is put in to achieve the goal. *Do not let perfect be the enemy of good.*

Goal setting ground rules:
- KR should be succinct, specific, measurable
- mix of outputs and inputs is helpful
- completion of all key results must result in attainment of the objective
- See table 4.2 page 55 for comparison of weak, average, strong OKRs

After OKRs are committed for the quarter, any add-on objectives or key results must fit the established agenda.
*- how does the new goal stack up against my existing ones?*
*- should something be dropped to make room for the new commitment?*

OKRs provide focus. When you commit to something, you are forfeiting something else. Inevitable consequence of allocating finite resources. **If we focus on everything, we focus on nothing.**

The art of management lies in:
**- you will have many activities of seemingly comparable significance**
**- need to select 2-3 that provides leverage well beyond others**
- focus on these selected activities

On a personal front too you need to select a 2-3 objectives and focus only on them.

**Need to build your goal muscles incrementally.** Start with top leadership committing to the  OKR system. Let yourself fail a few times, persevere, adapt it to make it your own.

# Superpower #2: Align and connect for Teamwork

At any given time, a significant number of people are working on the wrong things. Challenge is knowing which ones.

Public goals are more likely to be attained than private ones.
