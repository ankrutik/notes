# Measure What Matters
Tags: 

What is an Objective:
- what is to be achieved, no more, no less
- significant, concrete, action oriented, inspirational (?)
- should help against fuzzy thinking and execution

What are Key Results:
- benchmark and monitor how to get to that objective
- time bound 
- aggressive yet realistic
- measurable and verifiable
- a key result is met or not at all, no gray area
	- at a designated period, mostly a quarter, the KR is declared to be met or not
	- when a KR is meant for a longer period like a year, the KR itself keeps evolving
	- when OKRs are not met, they are probably not designed properly

Problems with traditional Goals:
- narrow focus
- unethical behaviour
- increased risk taking
- decreased cooperation
- decreased motivation


See *Dr. Grove's Basic OKR Hygiene* pg 33

Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them. - Andy Grove
```

Focus on and commit to handful of initiatives that can make a difference. Defer less urgent ones. No one company/individual can do it all.

Wrong decisions can be corrected once results start to come. Non-decisions or hastily abandoned decisions teach us nothing.

If you do not model it, no one will do it.
