# Watercolor Peter Wooley

2 types of line and wash:
- line first, then wash
- wash first, then line

## Line and wash
Line comes first for the outlines
Wash comes later.
Final finish with lines.

## Wash and Line
Wash comes first. Leave out highlights.
May need multiple passes. Wash, line, wash, line, wash.
Start with abstract low value wash. Then use outline to reinforce.
Then next level of value. Outline to support with more details.
Then heavy shadow and lines for finishing.

## Tone and Contrast
Take any colour photograph, reduce the contrast. You will see it becomes dull. Make it monochrome. You will see that the grays blend into each other.

Take the same colour photograph, increase the contrast. You will see details will start becoming sharper. Make it monochrome. You will still see that the grays will define and outline the details.

Observe the tonal properties of a scene before painting to understand contrast to bring out the details.

A prelim study sketch in pencil helps understand:
- lows 
- extremes
- how everything in between is distributed

Deviate and modify the tonal properties from the real world if it helps your painting.

Best way to understand this is to paint a scene in a single colour:
- Payne's Gray or Sepia, for example. Wide tonal range is needed here.
- Don't use something like Cadmium Yellow. 
- Start with a light tone of the colour. Then keep adding pigment to make the tone stronger.
- Don't increase the tone too much too fast.
- Objective is to make the scene more understandable or legible in each pass using contrast.


## Perspective
Where is the eye level? 
- Observe the scene for any lines that are descending
- Observe the scene for any lines that are ascending
- The lines in the scene in between the above 2 categories which do not seem to ascend or descend are at the eye level
