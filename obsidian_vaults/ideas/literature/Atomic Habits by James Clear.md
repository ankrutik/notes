# 1st Law make it obvious
Before we learn to create new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. 

```ad-quote
Unless you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate. 
```

### **Point and Call** 
 Explicitly call out parts of an process. For example, calling out loud all the things you need to carry when stepping out like keys, phone, etc. 

This forces you to use most of your senses during an action or process. 

Can be used to be aware of your habits and their triggers/cues. Calling out the effects of those habits helps resisting automatic execution of that habit. 

### Habit Score Card 
List down all habits or involuntary actions you take during a routine. For example, actions taken between getting up in the morning and after breakfast. 

Mark them as +, -, = to indicate positive, negative, neutral. 
Habits should not be looked at as positive or negative. Only judge them on their effectiveness in the long run. For example, smoking might calm your nerves immediately but does harm to your lungs in the long run. 

Be objective when noting down habits, as if you are observing the habits of someone else.
