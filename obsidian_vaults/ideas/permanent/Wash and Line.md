# Wash and Line
Tags: #watercolour/techniques 

Wash comes first. Leave out highlights.
May need multiple passes. Wash, line, wash, line, wash.
Start with abstract low value wash. Then use outline to reinforce.
Then next level of value. Outline to support with more details.
Then heavy shadow and lines for finishing.
