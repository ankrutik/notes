# RMM for REST
Tags: #tech #web

The Richardson Maturity Model for REST APIs shows levels of maturity in a REST API as per the following points:
1. URIs
2. Verbs
3. HATEOAS

## Level 0
Single URI for all APIs. Calls are differentiated with changes in payload. 

## Level 1
Multiple URIs for different APIs but all use the same verb, usually POST. 

## Level 2
Multiple URIs for different APIs and uses different verbs for CRUD operations like POST, GET, PUT, DELETE. 

## Level 3
Level 2 with HATEOAS
