- Phrasing happens over scales.
- Avoid phrasing that sounds like the scale being played up and down in a clean manner.
	- Play in certain style/tempo
		- "Shuffle" for blues
	- "Dirty" another note just before playing the note you want. 
		- Never use the root note to dirty.
		- In a Minor Pentatonic scale, use Flat third and Flat seventh
			- See "Scale degrees" of that scale to know these notes.
		- Use:
			- Vibrato
			- Up and down bends 
			- Slides
			- Hammer on and off
	- Make phrases that will return back to the root note.
		- Consider this blues chord progression: A, A, D, A, E, D, A, E
		- During the bar of each of the above chords:
			- Use other notes to make the lick
			- But resolve each lick to the root note of the chord
		- Dirty a note just before you resolve to the root note
