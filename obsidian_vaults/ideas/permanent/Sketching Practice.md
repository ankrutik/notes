- Use a pencil first, detail using pen
- Maintain loose pencil grip
- Contour drawing to get basic large shapes
- Perspective, parallel, horizon lines
- "Flow of lines"
	- When putting down a line, guide the tip of your pencil/pen in the motion or flow or trajectory of the lines observed in the subject
- First rough sketch with pencil should establish 3 dimensions for inking. 
	- This will be a guideline for next step
	- Minimum details
- Inking will be a separate detailing process instead of just tracing over pencils.
- Idea for complicated/dense/detailed scenes 
	- eg village with lots of roofs
	- Squint eyes to divide the scene into blocks
	- then draw the major blocks as shapes in proportion to each other
	- then observe the reference/subject and detail each shape part by part

## Look up
- Gesture drawing: quick 15 second without need to "finish"
