# Creating art
Tags: #art 

The output/end result really doesn't matter. The process of it is very relaxing and rewarding:
- figuring out proportions and scales
- figuring out distances between parts of the sketch
- sketching the details
- correcting the above
- observing the details and hues and tones
- figuring out colour hues and tones
- laying the colour
- detailing with brush and ink

Avoid the trap of going at every according to technique and these notes. You might want to invent a technique right then and there. Improvise. Like for example, painting/inking and dabbing it off is a valid technique done by artists but I had to do it without knowing.

Do not read more than a certain amount. It is more important to **DO**.
