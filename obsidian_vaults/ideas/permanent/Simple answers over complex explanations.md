# Simple answers over complex explanations
Tags: #mental-models

People tend to accept and propagate simple solutions/answers over complex nuanced ones even if they are wrong. 

This perception is often taken advantage of in politics. 

A defense used for this will be Ocham's Razor. But Ocham's Razor states the simpler of the correct and evidence based solutions should be chosen. Prerequisite being all solutions should be correct. So in my opinion, Ocham's Razor cannot be used.
