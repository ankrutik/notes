# Observing
Curves may not be actual curves but a series of almost straight lines. Especially in animal muscles.

## Eyes
Observe the eye sockets to get a sense of depth of the area around the eyes and how they sit on the face.
Draw a very faint outline of the eye sockets and then place the eyes in a relative position to the eye socket.
During painting, the eye socket may need a darker tone than the rest of the face.

## Detemining tones
Observe hues for the highlights, bright, mid, dark, shadow tones. 

Example, process of the rhino I painted:
- On first look, the rhino looks gray.
- On looking further, you see it is a mix of brown and gray.
- Went to my paint set. I took Vandyke Brown, but it was too brown. 
- Took Ivory Black and mixed very little in the Vandyke Brown. Tested on a rough paper. 
- Found it too black, mixed more Vandyke Brown into it to dominate the brown. Tested again and turned out fine.
