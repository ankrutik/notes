## Connections 
Questions to ask to find meaningful connections:
1. How does this idea fit in with what I already know?
2. Can this be explained by something else?
3. What does X mean for Y?
4. How can I used this idea to explain something else?

**More information -> More hooks to connect information -> More cues to trigger the right memory**
