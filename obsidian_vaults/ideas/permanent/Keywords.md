## Keywords
Find keywords when making your notes such that they should be:
- used more to retrieve information than to store it
- spotted by keeping an eye on topics you are working on or interested in, rather than looking at the new note in isolation

- Don't just:
	- which keyword is most fitting for this note?
	- which category does this note fall into?
- Do:
	- in which circumstances do I want to stumble upon this note?
	- when and how will I use this idea?
