- The rain outside
	- Sound of rain is like a background score
	- Metaphor to Charlie's emotional state
- Cinematography
	- Choice of ~~4:3~~  1.33:1 in a closed set
		- For verticality
	- ~~Wide angle?~~ No, mostly 50mm, wide open, shot close to the actors
	- Used Sony Venice and Angenieux Optimo Prime Lens 
	- Camera controlled remotely on an Aerojib to minimize distraction for the actors on set and COVid protocols 
	- High ISO
	- LiveGrain used for real time 3D motion picture film grain simulation
- Set design 
	- Grime outside the window
- Casting of daughter looks so much like the father 
- Soundstage in sound design
- After you know the ending, the entire week is a desperate exercise in doing his last right thing in bringing about good in his daughter. 
	- He stays positive about things in the face of an inevitability that he is sure of. 
	- He is ecstatic when he learns that his daughter might have done something good for someone. After which is he is blissfully ignorant about what might happen to him but just happy that his daughter can be saved. 
- Noteworthy aspects 
	- Staging and framing in the limited set
	- Acting performances are amazing 
- Scenes of Charlie gorging on food is almost like violence and gore. More so when you know the context behind that kind of eating. He has a disorder and is going to die.  
- [[Good art challenges you to not look away and comes out great in the end]]
	- Physical appearance, life choices, situation in life are all purposely reminded of with vividness to evoke a sense of disgust and sympathy 
	- Pratiksha was mad we chose to watch this film at late hours on a weekday but was emotionally moved when she stuck to watching it thru to the end. 
- I've come across many references of Moby Dick in art by now. This film, Metal Gear Solid V, and a few more I cannot recall. High time I need to read the book. 
- Cultural context of American setting that foreign audiences might not get
	- morbidly obese 
	- Poor, small town
- Brendan Fraser is not that obese. Prosthetics used.
