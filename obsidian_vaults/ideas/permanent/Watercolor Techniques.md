# Watercolor Techniques

## Roles of tone and value
What you do with tone is give an idea of the colour. 
What you do with value is give an idea of shape and shadow.

## Glaze
Glaze for soft edges:
1. Apply base colour, let it dry. 
2. Apply next colour on top of it partially.
3. Clean brush and charge with little water.
4. Pull second colour onto the base colour.

- wet on dry
- protect highlights

## Lifting
Apply paint. 
- While paint is wet
	- dry brush -> using the dry brush, lift the paint
	- put water on the part of the paint to lift -> dry brush -> now lift the water
	- 

Same when done with tissue paper, is called blotting.

### Overlapping layers to increase value
Multiple layering of wash makes areas darker



Check for scrubber brushes.
