# Fleeting Notes
Tags: #notes

## When/Where can they occur?
- shower thoughts
- walking thoughts
- epiphany with friends
- thing we see on the web
- quick ideas/thoughts of our own

## How to take them?
These can be copy pastes.
These should not be corrected for typos or formatting.

No need to stick to Obsidian for this. These can be taken as:
- Google Keep Notes
- handwritten notes on slips of paper
- paper notebooks when you want to have the pen-paper experience


## What to do with them?
They are reviewed and go directly into your permanent notes.
