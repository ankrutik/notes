# Why paint
Tags: #art

*Why do I paint and what keeps me interested in developing this skill?* 
It's a deliberate practice for me in developing something.

Way I look at it:
- *can this **skill be broken down into parts** which will need separate study and practice?* Yes. There are multiple techniques that yield different textures and work differently for different scenarios. 
- *can you do **deliberate practice**?* Yes. Applying washing in different situations, paint over paint, mixing colours, shadows, light to dark tone washes, highlights all these can be deliberately practiced
- *can you **track your progress** easily?* yes. Alternately choose scenes to paint as per your level of preparedness and one notch above. Check with yourself how easier it is for you to lay a technique than the last time. Check with your state of mind: anxious, at ease, stressed. 
- ***will it harm** you?* Nope. Doesn't harm physically or financially. Time will be spent if I go down rabit holes of 2 hours plus, harm is done mentally and to time. 
- *Can you **make practice more accessible**?* Yes. Keep your brushes, and palette, books cleaned and together. Helps enforce regular practice.
