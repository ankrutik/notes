# Plants Routine
Tags: #plants #routine

**Select plants to be watered** by using moisture meter to check soil. Some candidates: 
- dry soil
- between dry and moist for plants that need moist soil

**Aerate soil** by using a small trowel 
- in a pull up motion along the sides of the pot 
- away from the main root as much as possible
- be gentle

**Observe roots** 
	- to be white and healthy
	- If not, isolate plants that have unhealthy roots or root rot.

**Observe leaves**
	- plump and bounce
	- **Yellowing** can indicate
		- if soil is observed to be wet most of the time, overwatering
		- if watering is correct, too much sunlight
	- **Browning** can indicates 
		- if watering is correct, too much sunlight
		- if light is correct, underwatering
	- **Limpness** can indicate 
		- if watering is correct, a thirsty plant

If above corrections do not work, there might be root rot:
- rotten roots
- leaves not recovering

**Common rules when watering**
- water in spiral manner from the main root
- do not water board the pot

**Amount of watering**
- soil is dry, roots are healthy
	- wait for water to seep out at bottom
- soil is moist, plant needs moist soil
	- just enough to keep the soil moist
- plant is recovering from root rot
	- 2 tablespoons of water near main stem
