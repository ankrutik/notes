# Learning thought process
Tags: #art #sketching #learning

You have a value-system/style of your own that comes from techniques, styles, process that work for you.

When learning from books you might get so engrossed that those techniques will override your value-system/style instead of adding to it.

Be conscious of:
- is the book not working for you?
- are you regressing 
- are you starting from scratch such that it is not worth it?
- is your overall knowledge/value-system/style being overridden instead of added on?

When above problems are encountered, check the following:
- Are you being too rigid?
- Should you spend more time understanding/practicing/reading for the boo to make its point?

### Bert Dodson's Keys to Drawing
**Problem**: Looking away from sketch is causing problems in proportion and too many restating. Need to find a balance between looking at the subject and my sketch. 
**Solution**: Take away could be to look more at the subject than I normally would.
