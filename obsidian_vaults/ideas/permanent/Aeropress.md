## Notes
- Description of coffee

- Inspiration/reference/changes
	- This is a modified form of Tim Wendelboe's recipe.
	- Use the same recipe but increase the dose for strength. The coffee will stay smooth.
		- When on a trip to Aurangabad, I ground 14gm of coffee for Pratiksha who had already had instant coffee. I left the coffee in the grinder and we went on to visit the caves at Elora. By the time we returned, I had forgotten there was coffee in the grinder and ground another 14gm. I realized I was brewing 29gm of coffee only at the second stir of this recipe. The result was smooth, rich tasting coffee that was as strong as a punch to the face. Had not slept 2 nights prior to that because of driving but stayed awake that evening till 4am.
- Other recordings
	- How the water was heated?
		- Water was heated multiple times to figure out what temperature to use or rather how to measure the temperature in a steaming electric kettle. At the end I simply let it auto-cut off and waited 30 seconds. Nevertheless, the water was re-heated. Thought I should make a note of it.
	- Serving 
		- Below 60 degrees. Tastes better as it gets to body temperature.
		- Lightly stir before drinking every time. Do not be vigorous.
