# Atmospheric Perspective
Atmospheric perspective is a way to show depth in a painting by showing the effect of the atmosphere on objects in the fore, mid, and background.

Objects in foreground will retain their details,  colour, tonal values in full. Object farther away will have the same properties modified.

The level of modification of these properties shows how thick the atmosphere can be.
