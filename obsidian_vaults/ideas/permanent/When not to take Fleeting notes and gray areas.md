## When not to take them and gray areas?
Some pieces of literature are so dense with ideas that you would want to take lots of notes on them. In that case, start a new literature note.

Sometimes you might not have the time to take notes in your own words, as is expected when making literature notes. 
- In that case, start a new fleeting note for that peice of literature to do as-is copy-pasting. 
- Then create a separate literature note when you are reviewing that fleeting note.
- Consider bookmarking that literature and attempting it when you have the time.
