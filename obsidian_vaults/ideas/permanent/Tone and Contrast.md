# Tone and Contrast
Observe the tonal properties of a scene before painting to understand contrast to bring out the details.

A prelim study sketch in pencil helps understand:
- lows 
- extremes
- how everything in between is distributed

Deviate and modify the tonal properties from the real world if it helps your painting.

Best way to understand this is to paint a scene in a single colour:
- Payne's Gray or Sepia, for example. Wide tonal range is needed here.
- Don't use something like Cadmium Yellow. 
- Start with a light tone of the colour. Then keep adding pigment to make the tone stronger.
- Don't increase the tone too much too fast.
- Objective is to make the scene more understandable or legible in each pass using contrast.

### Detemining tones
Observe hues for the highlights, bright, mid, dark, shadow tones. 

Example, process of the rhino I painted:
- On first look, the rhino looks gray.
- On looking further, you see it is a mix of brown and gray.
- Went to my paint set. I took Vandyke Brown, but it was too brown. 
- Took Ivory Black and mixed very little in the Vandyke Brown. Tested on a rough paper. 
- Found it too black, mixed more Vandyke Brown into it to dominate the brown. Tested again and turned out fine.
