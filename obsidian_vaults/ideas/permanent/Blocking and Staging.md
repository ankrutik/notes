## Blocking
*How are the characters arranged in the scene/shot?*

## Staging
*How is the camera placed in relation to the blocking?*


## How do they work together?

Film scenes are mostly about characters interacting with each other, mostly using dialogue. 

The simplest approach can be to have, say 2, characters sitting next to each other and having a conversation while the camera shoots them.
A more dynamic approach than that would be a 2 camera setup where 1 camera shoots them from fron and the other 2 cameras will each shoot the one character over-the-shoulder from the other character.

More complex and artistic arrangements would use more complex movement of characters, surroundings, props, etc.

The concepts of staging and blocking can make a boring conversation or mundane scene interesting to watch.

Look for following being conveyed thru blocking and staging:
- shapes
- lines
- indirect commentary on the story

On a film set, a typical blocking/staging workflow would be as following:
1. the creatives will decide the blocking and staging first with no additional crew or maybe not even actors
2. stand-ins are brought in the scene to setup the camera and lighting
3. actors are then brought in; things might be tweaked at this point
4. the shot is then taken
