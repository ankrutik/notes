## Designing and Structuring
One atomic idea per note.

Create a new note such that this new note can be: 
- used to build on other ideas and information sets
- rearranged as per your thoughts and perspectives

Write in a manner that the reader has no context about the topic. More than others, it will help your current and future self.

This arrangement should never be used in a "top-down" manner where you first create categories like politics, technology, history, psychology, etc. and then add new notes to each category.
Instead, this should be viewed as a bottom-up approach where we make notes first and then see what grouping or lining can emerge.
