Extraordinary among recent releases. 
Watch this on a larger screen, not on a phone or laptop. 

GoT spin off released around the same time as another fantasy offering but that one seems amateurish as compared to this. 

Production quality shows in the costume, weapons, and other props. Fabrics used match the look of the characters.

Close attention payed to backgrounds whether practical sets or VFX. Shows the fantasy nature of the show. 

Dialogues written and delivered like literature instead of dumbing it down for mass audiences. Feels like a play at times.

## e1
Too many cuts at times. Galadriel orders everyone to move further at day light after they kill the snow troll. The shot is established well with thunder and light in the background and Galadriel facing away from the rest of the party. This shot could have been used further to show the literal laying down of arms. Scene cut too quick. [[Editing]] [[Blocking and Staging]]

## e2
The "Worm" attacks the cast away raft Galadriel is on with other survivors. She swims away. The camera moves above and below the surface as she swims because of the heavy waves. Each time the camera is above water, we see the progress of how the raft is destroyed.
