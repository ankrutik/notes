- Watching on large screen
	- Details are much clear and magnified
	- Would make sense sitting closer to the screen. A row before the middle row. 
	- Composition and scenery looks large and detailed
- Bharat sarkar bohot faltu kaam kar rahe hai aaj kal. People clapped at this. 
- Rhythm of the edit and immersion that it brings is something else on the big screen
- Teacher calls Dharmendra's chowkidar character to lift her bag. The entire scene lends a sense of weight. Another example of the immersion of the large screen.
- Texture of the clothes was much clear, fabric didn't look dated. Not sure if it is the high resolution scan or colour correction.
