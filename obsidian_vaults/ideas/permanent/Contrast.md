# Contrast
Take any colour photograph, reduce the contrast. You will see it becomes dull. Make it monochrome. You will see that the grays blend into each other.

Take the same colour photograph, increase the contrast. You will see details will start becoming sharper. Make it monochrome. You will still see that the grays will define and outline the details.
