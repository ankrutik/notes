Connect new notes to other notes in the system. These connections actually make your knowledge usable.

This aids in Intersectional Thinking which is the idea that the intersections between ideas is where creativity and innovation thrives.

Think about:
- how do the literature and fleeting notes **relate to your existing** interests, thinking, learning, research, etc?
- how will the new notes **add value** to your existing ideas, arguments, and discussions?
- is there a **connection** between what you have just learned and **what you already know**?
