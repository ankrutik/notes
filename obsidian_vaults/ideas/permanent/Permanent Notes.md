# Permanent Notes
These are the output of reviewing your fleeting and literature notes.

## Designing and Structuring
One atomic idea per note.

Create a new note such that this new note can be: 
- used to build on other ideas and information sets
- rearranged as per your thoughts and perspectives

Write in a manner that the reader has no context about the topic. More than others, it will help your current and future self.

This arrangement should never be used in a "top-down" manner where you first create categories like politics, technology, history, psychology, etc. and then add new notes to each category.
**Instead, this should be viewed as a bottom-up approach where we make notes first and then see what grouping or lining can emerge.**

Create a new permanent note only when:
- the subtopic is growing too big
- you would want to see the subtopic as a separate idea in a graph and not contribute to clutter

## Relating to other information
Connect new notes to other notes in the system. These connections actually make your knowledge usable.

This aids in Intersectional Thinking which is the idea that the intersections between ideas is where creativity and innovation thrives.

Think about:
- how do the literature and fleeting notes **relate to your existing** interests, thinking, learning, research, etc?
- how will the new notes **add value** to your existing ideas, arguments, and discussions?
- is there a **connection** between what you have just learned and **what you already know**?

## Connections 
Questions to ask to find meaningful connections:
1. How does this idea fit in with what I already know?
2. Can this be explained by something else?
3. What does X mean for Y?
4. How can I used this idea to explain something else?

**More information -> More hooks to connect information -> More cues to trigger the right memory**

## Keywords
Find keywords when making your notes such that they should be:
- used more to retrieve information than to store it
- spotted by keeping an eye on topics you are working on or interested in, rather than looking at the new note in isolation

- Don't just:
	- which keyword is most fitting for this note?
	- which category does this note fall into?
- Do:
	- in which circumstances do I want to stumble upon this note?
	- when and how will I use this idea?

## Tags
Tags can be applied to notes in Obsidian by creating blank links that do not point to any notes.
These blank links will be recognized and listed when adding links to other notes as well.

When such blank links are needed to be fleshed out with its own note, Ctrl+Click such a blank link from any note it is used in to create a new note.

## When storing permanent notes
- file a new note behind/along with a relevant note
- add links to this and all other relevant notes
- index and numbering to make discovery easier (applicable only to manual system)
