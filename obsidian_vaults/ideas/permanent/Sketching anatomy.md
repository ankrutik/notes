# Sketching anatomy
Look for anatomy references for your subjects like there are general rules/guideline for the human face.

## Portraiture
When doing faces, take the help of a circle and lines.
Start with the eyes

### Eyes
Observe the eye sockets to get a sense of depth of the area around the eyes and how they sit on the face.
Draw a very faint outline of the eye sockets and then place the eyes in a relative position to the eye socket.
During painting, the eye socket may need a darker tone than the rest of the face.
