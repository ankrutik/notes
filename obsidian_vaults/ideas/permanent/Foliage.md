# Foliage
Tags: #art #watercolour/techniques 

Do not use green hues straight out of the tube, they do not look natural. 

There needs to be a minimum of 3 hue variations. Do not put too much contrast between the hues. Maintain harmony.

Fan out when doing tree foliage.

Wait for the paint to dry before applying above layers.

Hold brush perpendicular to paper for strokes for details.

Very important to know when to stop. Minimum strokes.

Foliage is painted in 3 layers:
	1. Base layer 
		- Use the lightest tone
		- Relatively mid-wet brush
		- Helps denote volume and boundaries of foliage
		- Form the outline of the foliage with dabs and spots leaving enough negative space. Then fill in the foliage.
		- Body of the foliage will have negative space too. Any space left out by the brush can be used as gaps.
	2. mid tones
		- wet brush for soft edges
		- apply in a manner to show shapes made up of the lightest tone
		- starting to show shadow
		- use dots to show leaves
	3. dark tones
		- Apply sparingly and only on the mid tones
		- mid wet brush for detailing
		- use dots to show leaves
		- best used as a sharp detailing device


## Observations from real life
- The foliage on the tree can be thought of as a collection of "bunches of leaves".
- All such bunches will be propped up by branches.
- Note the direction of the growth of branches to get a rhythm or direction in the structure of the plant.
- The darker old leaves and the shadow will fall on the lower side of such bunches.
- Squint eyes to get the shape of the foliage. Your aim should be to capture the shape of the foliage rather than the colour.
