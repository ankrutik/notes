# Foliage
Tags: #watercolour/techniques 

## General points

- Do not use green hues straight out of the tube, they do not look natural. 
- There needs to be a minimum of 3 hue variations. Do not put too much contrast between the hues. Maintain harmony.
- Fan out when doing tree foliage.
- Wait for the paint to dry before applying above layers.
- Hold brush perpendicular to paper for strokes for details.
- Very important to know when to stop. Minimum strokes.

## Observations from real life
- The foliage on the tree can be thought of as a collection of "bunches of leaves".
- All such bunches will be propped up by branches.
- Note the direction of the growth of branches to get a rhythm or direction in the structure of the plant.
- The darker old leaves and the shadow will fall on the lower side of such bunches.
- Squint eyes to get the shape of the foliage. Your aim should be to capture the shape of the foliage rather than the colour.

## Approach from most YouTubers
Foliage is painted in 3 layers:
	1. Base layer 
		- Use the lightest tone
		- Relatively mid-wet brush
		- Helps denote volume and boundaries of foliage
		- Form the outline of the foliage with dabs and spots leaving enough negative space. Then fill in the foliage.
		- Body of the foliage will have negative space too. Any space left out by the brush can be used as gaps.
	2. mid tones
		- wet brush for soft edges
		- apply in a manner to show shapes made up of the lightest tone
		- starting to show shadow
		- use dots to show leaves
	3. dark tones
		- Apply sparingly and only on the mid tones
		- mid wet brush for detailing
		- use dots to show leaves
		- best used as a sharp detailing device

## Approach from WHJ Boot

````ad-important
This is the best and most satisfying approach so far.
````

1. Draw a rough outline and structure with a light pencil.
2. Squint eyes to get rough outline
3. Do not include too much detail. This succinctness will come with practice and mastery.
4. Draw leaves in the strongest light first.
	1. Round size 8 brush, **brought to a pointed tip** on the palatte.
	2. Suggested stroke: push the pointed tip upwards on the paper to create individual leaves.
	3. Dab such little leaves for outline, then connect a bunch of them with a local wash to draw mass. Create such detached sprays of foliage.
	4. Wait for this to dry.
5. Draw branches and twigs. 
	1. Connect detached spray of foliage. 
	2. Shadow on lower side of branches and where the branch disappears into the foliage.
	3. Wait for this to dry.
7. Go about the darker and shadow parts.
	1. Similar approach as in step 2.
	2. Masses of foliage in some places.
	3. Use individual dabs to do details in other places.
