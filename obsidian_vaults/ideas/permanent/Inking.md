# Inking
Tags: #art

The following notes are for Sumi E ink.

This ink is permanent but can be picked-up/wiped-off to some extent immediately after applying.

Roll the brush on the pallete or on the serated cap of the water penbrush to bring the brush to a point.

Use thin lines to highlight topographical features of the subject to give a sense of shape and detail.
Topographical features:
- bone structure
- muscles
- wrinkles and creases

Applying ink and dabbing off can be used as technique when you don't want the highlight standing out.
