## Natural
Coffee allowed to dry slowly, then fruit is stripped away in de-pulping machine. 
Fruitier and berry like. 

## Washed
De-pulped then mucilage removed by washing in water. 
Clean, crisp, lighter. Fruity. 

## Honey
De-pulped but mucilage is left on bean
- white: 80-90% removed
- yellow: 50% removed
- Red: 10-20% removed 
- Black: 100% fruit on bean
Cleaner than natural, mellower than washed. Syrupy. More acidity. 
## Anaerobic fermentation
Fruit removed by fermenting in absence of oxygen in a seal tank. Generates certain acids like lactic. 
May or may it use yeast. 
Output is then processed further using natural, honey, washed processing. 
Funky, yellow fruity, sweet, complex. 
Adventurous choice.
