Tried a similar “sweet cream” with a nitro cold brew at Starbucks. 

Measurements from [@pullandpourovercoffee](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CydhaKTOcW5/)
- Vanilla extract as per taste
- 157 ml cream
- 60 ml milk

Ratio is approx 2.61
In peg terms, 60ml cream and 45ml milk

For ~80ml South Indian Filter brew:
- Dash of vanilla extract as per taste
- 63gm cream
- 43gm milk

Ingredients preferably right out of a fridge. 
Add everything to a jar and shake.

Very good alternative to plain milk in coffee, cold or hot.
