Tried a similar “sweet cream” with a nitro cold brew at Starbucks. 

Vanilla extract
157 ml cream
60 ml milk

Preferably right out of a fridge. 

Add above to a jar and shake.

Ratio is approx 2.61
So in peg terms, 60ml cream and 45ml milk

Very good alternative to plain milk in coffee, cold or hot.
