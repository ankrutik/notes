## Things needed
- Key Cap puller is mandatory
- Brush
- Rubbing Alcohol, as pure as possible
- Clean handkerchief
- Basic Notepad application without autocorrection or autocompletion
- **Cling wrap**
- **Masking Tape**
- small scissors
- Foam
## Replacing Key Caps
Press onto the switches gently. 
### For keys that need stabilisers
1. Attach the stabiliser mounts/pins to the stabiliser wire/rod first. 
2. Settle the wire/rod down. 
3. Then settle the mounts/pins in their holders/seats on the keyboard.
4. At this point, the keycap should have nothing on them. Except for o rings if you are using them. 
5. Then eyeball the keycap onto the switch and 2 stabiliser pins. 
This is the correct way that gives much more stability than attaching the stabiliser pins/mounts onto the keycap first. 

## Stuck keys
Keycaps might not be a perfect fit for your keyboard. Use **sand paper** to sand off plastic off the inner walls of the key cap.
## Rattle
For the **space bar**, if the key rattles too much, insert small pieces of **cling wrap** into the stems of the keycap before assembly. They will give a better and tighter fit on the stabilizer and switch stems. This seems to be very effective at the moment. The issues seems to be more with the Stabilizer stems than the Switch stems.

Consider **foam** for stabilized keycaps. Helps immensely.

For backspace, shift, enter keys, line the inside walls of the keycaps with tiny pieces of **masking tape**. Use 3 layers. This absorbs some of the rattle and vibration. If the keys are getting stuck, one of the sides of tape might need to be removed.
## Multiple key presses
- *This issue has completely gone away from the Filco keyboard after I replaced all the key caps.*
- Use basic notepad application to test keys to avoid **any autocompletions and corrections** during
- After key is identified, pull cap using key puller
- Brush off any visible dust
- Spray few spritzes into cap of alcohol spray to accumulate a few drops
- Press down the switch of the key and pour the alcohol into the body of the switch
- Press the switch a few times and see that the signal is proper using notepad
- Do not wait for the alcohol to dry, wipe off any excess with a handkerchief
- Replace key cap and test
