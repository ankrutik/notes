## Things needed
- Key Cap puller is mandatory
- Brush
- Rubbing Alcohol, as pure as possible
- Clean handerkerchief
- Basic Notepad application without autocorrection or autocompletion
## Replacing Key Caps
Press onto the switches gently. 
### For keys that need stabilisers
1. Attach the stabiliser mounts/pins to the stabiliser wire/rod first. 
2. Settle the wire/rod down. 
3. Then settle the mounts/pins in their holders/seats on the keyboard.
4. At this point, the keycap should have nothing on them. Except for o rings if you are using them. 
5. Then eyeball the keycap onto the switch and 2 stabiliser pins. 
This is the correct way that gives much more stability than attaching the stabiliser pins/mounts onto the keycap first. 
## Method

- Press down the switch of the key and pour the alcohol into the body of the switch
- Press the switch a few times and see that the signal is proper using notepad
- Do not wait for the alcohol to dry, wipe off any excess with a handkerchief
- Replace key cap and test
