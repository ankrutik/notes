Ease of extraction [[Brewing by Coffee Processing#Order of easy extraction|is the easiest]]

### Resting
- [[standout sookoo]] 21 days
	- roasted on 13/6/2025, tasted noteworthy on 4/7/2025

### Approach
- Coarse grind and more pours
	- 52 to 60 Red Clix
	- 3 pours or more 
- ! [[Bypass with Coffee|Cup last ratios separately]]

### Double Bloom
A recipe that I've come to discover separately on my own and on  STANDOUT as the Double Bloom.

- Pour 1
	- Close to 3 times weight of coffee
		- Little more if needed
- Pour 2
	- At 30 seconds
	- Same pour weight as Pour 1
- Pour 3
	- *During dial in...*
		- Pour same weight in separate cups
		- Taste what is needed in your final cup
	- *After dial in...*
		- Pour remaining dialled in weight post Pour 2 in single go

Pour 3 is a single pour to avoid extracting further since fermented coffees are very soluble. Example, [[intellect cereza hidden alchemy]]

### Carbonic Maceration vs Anaerobic Fermentation
- Carbonic maceration uses full cherry, anaerobic requires pulped cherry.
- Both are fermentation in the absence of oxygen.
