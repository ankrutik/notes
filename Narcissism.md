> Erich Fromm, one of the world’s foremost psychoanalysts and social philosophers, who has delved deep into the mind of the narcissist and his symbiotic connection with his submissive “masochistic” devotee, helps us understand the bizarre idol worship in our country today. According to Fromm, man’s sanity depends on his relatedness and communion with other human beings. This transcending of lonely individual existence and unifying with the other humans is achieved by the narcissist through domination and by the bhakt through submission but in the process of feeding on each other, they both lose their integrity and freedom. At the same time, they lose the capacity for the one passion that inspires solidarity with our fellow creatures which is love and empathy.
