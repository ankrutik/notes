## Putting it all together
- Comparatively new medium
- Deliberate choices by artist that affects how we feel when watching
- Some concepts are for appreciating on your own
- Some concepts are to be discussed
- We bring our tastes, preferences, experiences, backgrounds, politics to the films we watch
- Only wrong way to interpret is to say yours is the only way
- Don't do such analysis all the time, watch it for fun.
## Asking Why
- Analysing any art comes down to 2 steps
	- describe what you see 
		- look closely
	- ask why?
		- choice of artist in aspects like 
			- colour
			- composition
			- lighting
			- realism vs abstract
			- any other aspect that you can catch
- "Art is subjective"
	- You can question the artist's decisions and say they are wrong from how you think of it

## What is the Story saying
- Look at the events in the film from a macro level and describe them
	- How does it start?
	- What happens?
	- How does it end?
	- what are the main conflicts?
	- how are they resolved?
	- how do the characters change?
- Prototype your descriptions
	- Simplify them
		- from verbose, descriptive
		- to succinct, thematic
- Repeat process to find more themes

## Visual Language
- "Mise en scene" or "What is in the frame?"
	- costumes, set, lens, lighting, etc.
	- how are the tools of cinema deployed?

## Style of aesthetic
- First few minutes sets visual style
- When you don't like aesthetic, assume that the filmmakers chose to do it that way then ask why?
- *Where is the film on a scale of Realism vs Formalism?*
- Classicism is Realist elements combined with Formalist elements
	- Realist elements
		- naturalistic performances, locations, subtle editing, linear continuity, etc.
	- Formalist elements
		- musical score, camera angles, camera movements, etc.

## Perspective
- objective perspective
	- outside observer
	- no emotional involvement
- subjective perspective
	- film language deployed to convey what the characters feel
- changes scene to scene and even shot to shot

## Lenses
- Focal length
	- Short, Wide
		- fits more of the environment in the frame
		- can be used to exaggerate
	- Long, Narrow, Compressed
		- isolate subjects
		- make them look flattering
- What height is the lens placed with respect to the subject?
- Complete art and freedom in choice and use of lenses to convey different things

## Colour
- Sets, costumes, lighting, correction in post production
- Same colour can convey different ideas in different films
	- Colour vocabulary or theme of each film
- Warm vs Cold colours
- Colours can be used in exaggeration to convey extremes
- Don't seek much meaning, just appreciate how it is used
- Colours of individual elements in the same shot/scene to convey contrast of ideas

## Aspect ratio
- Film maker may need taller or wider frames to capture shots to convey what they want to say.

## Lighting
- Sets the Mood, Atmosphere, Reality
- Where/What should the audience look at?
- Ideally should not be intrusive
- High Key
	- Frame is fully lit
- Low Key
	- Few lights used

## Blocking and Camera Movement
- Blocking is the movement of camera and characters within the frame
- Choice of movement depicts
	- energy of the scene
	- intimacy of perspective
- Establish physical position of elements or geography of set or situation
- Some types of movements
	- Pan
		- movement along x axis
	- Tilt
		- movement along y axis
	- Zoom
		- lens in fixed position
		- movement within lens
		- change in focal length
	- Tracking
		- camera is moved
		- gimbal, dolly, steadycam
	- Crane/Helicopter/Drone
	- Handheld

## Editing
- Should not be intrusive

## Sound
- Where does the music or folly work sit in the scale of Real and Formal?
- Impact of the mood and genre of the film

## Auteur Theory
- Director may not always be the auteur
	- Writer, producer, background score composer, production house could be the auteur

## Cinema history
- Similar scenes or plot points might not always be rip offs
	- If the filmmaker has re-used certain concepts, how did they choose to use it?
		- Innovatively to create something of their own
		- Lazily
- Films are in conversation with each other

## Genre
- Mostly for marketing, do not rely too much on it.
- Films can have elements from multiple genres.

## Other Lenses
- Multiple lenses can be applied
	- Gender
	- Religion
	- Sexuality
	- Social Class
	- Politics
- Process
	- Observe
	- Describe
	- Break down in simplest terms
	- Ask why?
