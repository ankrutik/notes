There are too many instructions from drawing lessons that are difficult to remember when drawing. The lessons from this book at least need to be **absorbed into our own system of drawing**. Concentrate on the subject and t**rust your eyes**.

Use **practical dialogue** to ask questions about the subject. Talk to yourself about the subject in a curious than a judgemental tone.

While in the activity of sketching, spend more time looking at the subject than your sketch. Glance at your drawing only to keep lines on track. Glancing at your sketch should be treated as a precious time commodity. **Draw blind**.

Repeat to yourself **triggering words** that describe parts of the subject that you're drawing.

Look at the subject, hold the contours in your mind, draw the lines. Look hold draw. **Look hold draw**.

Refer to diagram on page 12

Views on **restating lines**:
- avoids wasting time in erasing which you can spend observing the subject more
- makes sketch feel more energetic and dynamic
- for the viewer, it is a good loo into how the sketch changed over time

**Squint eyes** to reduce detail when you needed. Like when you want to just focus on the outline or when overwhelmed by detail.

**Individualize** your subjects by observing and sketching what is unique to that subject.

Shift from language of things to language of lines and shapes:
1. Draw large shapes first.
2. Draw enriching shapes next; highlights, shadow, reflections, texture, patterns, etc.
3. Tie the shapes together.
4. When you see a "trapped" shape, draw it.

Signs to stop due to **fatigue**:
- you are drawing from knowledge of a thing than shape
- you become time conscious
- you start noticing distractions

Capture the most interesting parts of your subject before fatigue sets in.


## The Artists Handwriting

The handwriting of an artist can be noticed at looking at the insignificant parts of the painting.

2 modes:
- intuitive (free)
- analytical (controlled)

Problem occurs when we end up using both at the same time.

Take an empty brush or a pencil/pen in the air over sketches that great artists have done to get a feel for speed and stroke.

Copy works of great artists to share their mechanical experience. Once you get their handwriting, you can emulate them: do your own work in their style. This is just for study purpose.

Free hand: 
- bring your grip back till the pen/pencil dangles
- use your elbow and shoulder
