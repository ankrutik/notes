- visual texture 
	- fixtures from the 80s and 90s like telephone booths
	- Hand painted, faded signs
- multi color lighting 
	- different coloured back lights for contrast and mystery 
- Katrina is shown very ominous
	- Almost feels like she is the serial killer 
- homage to old cinema
- Luke Kenny dummy acting
- complicated fleshed out stories told by the characters
- Tension on thru out the films
