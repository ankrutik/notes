Director: Avinash Arun
Cinematographer: Avinash Arun
Editor:

- Wes Anderson establishing shots. Leading lines and perspective maintained meticulously. 
- Transitions are mostly cuts to nature shot which makes the film very enjoyable
- Three of us  
	- could easily be Shailaja, Dipankar, Pradeep
	- but the film seems to be more about a Shailaja of the past that is being sought, the present day Shailaja on aware of dementia, and the Shailaja that is imminent. 
- Pradeep mixes Deepika with Jyoti. Wrote that way because names are same. 
- Relatable to me personally
	- places from your childhood which you visit after years or decades look much smaller
	- in a collection of photographs taken by a photography enthusiast, the photographer is rarely seen but their presence is felt
- Varun Groverâ€™s dialogue writing is brilliant
	- Reminds me of Anurag Kashyap trining dialogue writer to film maker
- Very nice background score
- Coincidentally, just 2 days ago, watch a film with similar theme, Past Lives. 


Watched on 20240203 at home on Netflix
