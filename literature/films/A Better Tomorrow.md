Director: John Woo
Cinematographer: Wong Wing-hang
Editor: Kam Ma, David Wu
Tech:

- Beautiful cinematography and use of colour
- Surprises in writing
- Too much drama, although very good. Feels like a TV show at times  
- Brother’s character is an idiot plot for both the gangsters and the police. He was the foil from the start for seen by the nightmare that Ho has.
- You’re rooting for Mark’s character. But you know it’s going to be a tragedy.
- Film is about…
	- Toxicity of an idealist yet immature young brother, whose lack of nuance in life ruins many relationships.
	- Coldness of a system and anti system. Human coexisting in that world.
	- Extremes of forgiveness— obsession with redemption and ego.
- Distant remake of Deewar (1975)
