#film/notes

Feels like a proper Hollywood film from the 80s and 90s. Tight sets, cinematography, lighting, framing. Something you'd study in film school.
Lot of tension build and release shots. Even a comedy-drama was directed like an action film. Feels like entertainment.

All worldly problems that came to such a peak were forgotten the next day. What matters is what persisted. Family. Satisfaction of journalistic integrity.
