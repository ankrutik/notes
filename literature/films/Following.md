Director: Christopher Nolan
Cinematographer: 
Editor:

- Christopher Nolanâ€™s first film
- All of his current storytelling signatures are present in this film
	- Nonlinear plot
	- Time jumps between parallel story tracks
	- Droning, background music
	- Un-choreographed fighting
	- All of the above seems to be scaled and polished in his current films due to high production value and resources. He was ready for all of this in 1998. 
- *Are we as audience of the film following their lives in a form of voyeurism?*
- Exceptional lighting in low light locations given the small budget.
- The film is set in 1998, but almost no digital or electronic equipment is shown, especially the flat of the protagonist. 
- Intertwining plot that chooses to reveal information at certain times that uncovers secrets and also deceives.
