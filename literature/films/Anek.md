- Great framing, writing
- Rushed direction and editing
	- Almost seems like they could have done better with some more time and resources
- Lighting And colour greeting was visually delicious
- Certain shots were framed and held to convey messages. Rare attempt in todayâ€™s Overcrowded film making. 
- Memorable and remarkable topics touched
	- Unfamiliarity of the common Indian with the north-east states
	- Convoluted relationship between government and militia
	- Conflicts between politicians and bureaucracy
	- North-east and minority states have to keep Proving themselves
	- Politics of surgical strikes and films
	- Contrast between the attitudes of undercover regions and military
	- Abrar plays football on live television news in a rowdy and rough manner with the North-eastern youth
- One of the rare films from Indian cinema that is not jingoistic when the subject of the film has to do with the nation
- The film uses end credit scenes to convey another last point. The filmmaker is aware of this trend and the attention they can hold over an audience exiting the theatre.
