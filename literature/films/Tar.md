- Wonderful performance by Cate Blanchet and all the other actors.
- Camera movement and framing is crisp and succinct
- Staging and framing
	- Scene where Lydia and Sharon argue in the car
	- Lydia approaches the stair case going down in the decrepit building searching for the cellist.
		- Lydia's car is shown on the other side of the passage she just walked thru. There is a door frame that shows a staircase going down.
		- Lydia has followed her desire(passage) and is now descending further(staircase) leaving a fragment of her perfect life(car) behind.
- Lydia's choice of electric car shows her aversion to noise.
- Lydia has an aversion to noise but is creating noise for others. Her choice of perfect silence is a form of selfishness: her neighbours are disturbed, she scolds her daughter for going into her study. 
	- Similar to what Gopalan warned me being so sensitive to noise and the effect it has.
- The fifth
	- Malers 5th is what she is working to record. The folder containing her fifth is missing. The masseur that chooses her is number 5.
- God complex shown thru her idea that she controls time.
- Lydia is an immensely shrewd politician.
