- jingoism, propaganda film
	- The “good Muslim” concept jingoistic film that is necessary to exist to not leave room for a more rapid flavour of jingoism
	- Full, drawn out minority community burial scenes will force jingoistic ticket buyers to watch a flavour of patriotism that might churn their guts 
- usual lack of militant/terrorist nuance
- great shots of aircraft and actors in the opening credit song
- reminds of Hrithik’s acting from Mein Prem Ki Deewani Hu
- less airforce pilots, more teenage drama
- Vishal-Shekhar were probably tired/bored making the soundtrack
- Hrithik’s character is annoying enough to not have been part of any professional airforce team
- why is Deepika’s character attracted to Hrithik’s character??!
