Routine of Hirayama's day is show with less detail every progressing iteration. What remains can be considered what is very important to him. Like looking at the sky and smiling as he steps out. Dreams and sleep is very important, almost like a measure of his well-being.

Sound of sweeping is his alarm. There are people in the city that wake up earlier than him. Somewhat precede his stoic standing. All of them probably have their own understanding with their lives.

As the coffee enters his system, he enters the system of the city. Like flowing into the veins of a living organism or joining the sea thru a river.

The shot of his house as he pulls away to work. His window is shown in contrast in purple to indicate his warm home in the vastness of the city.

The sky tree reminds me of the Erd Tree in The Elden Ring.

Makes we want to put on gloves and clean my bathrooms and home. With a sponge and cloth.

A meditative routine to pacify a human urge for complicated attachments.

The toilets are art pieces, places of human reprieve, hiding spots for children playing, safe havens for lost kids.

Japanese community not blindly venerated. Most of the unknown individuals making use of the toilets are insensitive.

Takashi actor is very good. Redemption is how he treat Dera-chan.

Photographs of foliage of trees as viewed from below. Plants considered almost like friends or maybe observed as wild animals on a safari. Saplings are nurtured with permission from temple priests.

Translucent toilet. Sunlight echoing inside. Almost like you are relieving yourself in nature but in a civilised manner. 

Hirayama views the homeless person with a feeling of either feared inevitability or empathy. A border condition he is monitoring for his own old age.

Seems spraying plants is important. As I have experienced myself lately.

Almost like the dinner place owner was asked by Hirayama to serve his food with a "for your hard day's work" preface.

Always give respect to sports teams and religions of others. Give paw.

No TV. Only listening to music and reading.

Analogue music. Something about the lack of control over switching away from what you are listening to. Hirayama is not obsessed with the aesthetics of analog. He comes from a time where this is the familiar technology so he uses it without the need for the features of digital. "Reduction to the essential" as Win Wenders says. Working with what he has.

Dreams. Glimpses of memory and emotions over a background texture of the under foliage photographs and observations her makes.

Hirayama smiles. An oasis in his experiences. He's sure about what he is abstaining from and what he allows. He lives those little moments fully.

Niece Niko. Arrival disrupts his routine, sleep, energy levels, and attachments.

Routine. When Takashi quits and he has to do extra work, it is a bit beyond why he chose this life. When Takashi's replacement arrives, he is happy more so because he can get back to his routine than being relieved from the extra work.

Niko as a younger generation laughs at Hirayama's, as an older generation's, ignorance. But elder people do not do that to younger people.

Humiliation. Doesn't get too angry at discriminating experiences shown 2 times in the film.

*Next time is next time. Now is now.*

Wonderful use of Nina Simone's I'm Feeling Good. It was made sure that Koji Yakusho understood each line and reacted to both the lyrics and music.

Films is almost one that I can watch over and over again.
