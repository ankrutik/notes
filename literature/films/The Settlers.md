"Ends of the Earth" colonised by lowest of European civilisation. Mostly arm twisted by the excreted humanity involved in wars.

Setting is the early days of Chile during the rule of Spain.

Suffering of mixed race individuals trying to resolve with whom they belong. A disappearing race and lineage that are unrecognisable to them or an imposing superiority of a race that has held them unequal.

Brilliant visuals thru what looks like old Zeiss Contax Lenses used on digital camera body. Spherical distortion, chromatic aberration, vignetting, and bright contrasting colours gives an immense texture to the images.

Savagery of genocide to cull humans like pests followed by rape. How much human savagery has not changed.

Rosa looks at Segundo with empathy twice. Once in the English colonel camp and second during the interview. She is more defiant than Segundo. Especially in the filming scene at the end.

The trio of state, business, and religion in discussion. The business is given a free hand by the state and then replaced when not needed or becomes too powerful. Religion watching over the entire process. Same occurred when the East India Company was replaced.

Native are shown savagery from the state and capitalists. Then forced to be part of a pretty new culture of gentlemen and ladies. Rosa suffers a defiance in both.

End credits show actual footage from that era. Has an effect of re-imagining the film.

Tight typography thruout film.
