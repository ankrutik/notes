Introspection
- actively paying attention to one’s thoughts and feelings. 
- This ability helps us imagine, remember, reflect 
- and use these reveries to solve problems, innovate, create. 

In distress, introspection does more harm than good. 
- undermines performance at work
- Interferes with good decisions
- Negatively influences relationships 

Chatter
- cyclic negative thoughts and emotions

As naturally as we breathe, we decouple from the present and our brains transport us into
- past events
- Imagined scenarios
- Internal musings
Default state that our brain reverts to when not engaged and most of the times when we are actually engaged. 
==Be aware of this default state.== 

Internal talk to ourselves is very fast, almost like 4000 words per minute if spoken out loud. 

Occurs when we do not want it
- When stressed
- Sticks are high
- Difficult emotions that Needs utmost poise

Forms
- Rambling soliloquy 
- Dialogues with ourselves
- Rumination or rehashing of past events
- Worry or imagining of future events
- Free associated pin bowling between negative feelings and ideas
- Fixation on unpleasant feeling or notion

Can torment, paralyse, or even lead to things that sabotage us 

Key to beating chatter is to stop talking to yourself, but figuring out how to do it more effectively
The mind and world around us are designed to help us do that. 

# Chapter 1

Thoughts about unpleasant emotions aren’t always chatter if they do not spiral.

The mind is an avid time traveller, jumps thru space and time thru inner conversations.

Ability of the mind to time travel is an exceedingly valuable feature of the human mind. Nothing inherently harmful unless it leads to chatter.

Inner dialogues:
- negative content
- Associative connections
- Verbal thinking, constructive and otherwise
- Self-focused
- Inescapable need to make sense of our experiences

Humans exist in a world of words

Brain has built-in tendency to disconnect from the world around us. This leads to conversations in our mind for most of our waking hours.

“Working memory”

“Phonological loop”
- Critical component of working memory
- Neural system that specializes in managing verbal information
- “Inner ear” for retaining words heard seconds ago
- “Inner voice”
- Used to keep our linguistic neural pathways online to maintain internal dialogues while we go about doing things in the world

Full-blown, unprompted conversations that children have with themselves is a sign of neural and emotional growth.

Religions and values bleed into household norms. Voice of culture influences our parents and in turn influences us. Combination of many cultures and generations.

Inner voice helps control ourselves by evaluating goals we have set for ourselves.
- Part of reaching goals is making right choices
- Inner voice helps run mental simulations

Sleep and dreams
- multi-reality brainstorming also takes place when we sleep
- Dreams are brain’s way of interpreting random brain-stem firings during REM sleep
- Dreams share similarities with spontaneous verbal thoughts when awake
- Waking verbal mind converses with sleeping one
- Dreams are often functional and highly attuned to our practical needs

Role in creation of our selves
- brain constructs meaningful narratives thru autobiographical reasoning
- Helps us mature
- Figure out values and desires
- Deal with change and adversity by rooting us in a continuous identity
- Language helps combine unconnected fragments of the day in a cohesive line
- Words of the ind sculpt the past and sets up narrative to follow in the future
- Internal monologues weave a neural narrative of recollections to construct our identity

Inner experiences dwarfed outer ones. What we think is a better predictor of our mood that what we are doing.

# Chapter 2
Distractions
- Sights and sounds
- Thoughts and feelings that these stimuli spark

Attention
- Allows us to filter out things that don’t matter
- To allow us to focus on the things that we need to do
- Is in voluntary
- Unique capability in humans to consciously concentrate on the tasks that require attention

Inner voice helps us when Overwhelmed by emotion
- Narrow attention on the obstacles, we encounter
- Exclude practically everything else
- Not helpful when we need attention to for an automatic and learned skill
- Over focuses our attention on parts of behaviour that only function as the sum of its parts
	- Paralysis by analysis

Executive functions
- Foundation of our ability to steer thoughts and behaviour in the ways that we desire
- Supported network of prefrontal brain regions located behind a forehead and temples
- Intervene when our instinctual processes are not sufficient 
- Consciously guide our behaviour
	- Keep relevant information active in our mind
	- Filter out extra information
	- Block out distractions
	- Play with ideas
	- Point attention where it needs to go
	- Exercise self control
- Require you to leave automatic mode
- Limited capacity
	- Magic number four
	- Negative in a voice hogs neural capacity
	- Verbal rumination concentrates attention on source of emotional distress
	- Chartered devices and blows out attention

Anxiety let people are known to make low, initial offers, exit, discussion, only, and earn less money. 

The more intense and emotion, the more people want to talk about it. Strong emotions, blush, people of into sharing their experiences. The only exception to the rule is when people feel shame which they wish to conceal or certain forms of trauma which they want to avoid dwelling on.

Voicing thoughts excessively and are pushing away the people we need most . The pain of chatter makes people less sensitive to normal social cues.

Limited threshold for how much vent we can listen to. Relationships thrive on reciprocity. 

Over venting people are less capable of solving problems. Makes harder to fix relationships. Vicious cycle that leads to loneliness and isolation. 

More likely to behave aggressively. This aggression is displaced on people that don’t deserve it. 

Social media points of concerns
- empathy
	- lack of visual social cues that discourage unsocial behaviour
- Time
	- actual in person interaction with people is preceded by waiting time during which people get time to reflect upon and temper their emotions 

Social media can fuel other people’s chatter
- sharing makes us feel better but can make others feel worse
- Social high is a neuronal high for our dopamine receptors

Stress is an adaptive response for quickly and efficient handling of potentially threatening situations. Negative verbal stream can make stress chronic. 

Chemical messengers curb systems in your body that are not vital during stress. 

Chronic negative thoughts are shown to have physical impact as well as mental. 

Who we are = Genes + Environment 

Just because you have a gene doesn’t mean that it affects you. What determines who we are is whether those genes are turned on or off. 

Piano keys. Not all are pressed, some more than others. Gene expression is similar. 

When chatter activates threat systems frequently, inflammation genes are triggered. These protect in short term but harm in the long term.  At the same time, cells carrying out daily functions are turned off. Openings for illness and infections. 

*Very simple explanations, be careful.* 

# Chapter 3

Loosing perspective
- chatter that does the following…
	- zoom in close to an idea
	- Inflame Emotions 
	- exclude all other ways of looking at a situation That might cool us down
- magnifies adversity
- Loose ability to zoom out and gain perspective

Cyclic nature of chatter and negative emotions
- brain regions involved in self-referential processing activated
- Stree response mechanisms: adrenaline, cortisol
- Further revs up negative verbal stream
- Unable to escape and gain a wider angled view

Subtleties between solutions
- Distraction
	- effective but a short term fix since the problem is still present and waiting.
	- Procrastination.
- Mindfulness
	- observing/looking at your stream of thoughts from distance
- Distancing
	- engaging in your stream of thoughts with a distance

One can view memories from different perspectives. Not necessary the same images will play out in the head.

Immersers
- event viewed from first person perspective
- Trapped in verbal flood and emotions
- Descriptions focus on hurt

Distancers
- broad, third party observers
- clear, complex thinking
- Emerge from experience with a constructive story
- Stepping back to make sense of our experience changes the tone of our inner voice

Physical effects of distancing
- reined in cardiovascular response to stress
- Dampened emotional activity in brain
- Less hostility And aggression
- Works with extreme forms of inner voice torment

Shortens duration of people’s negative moods. Puts out chatter bush fires.

If you want to hold onto positive experiences, immerse.

Psychological immersion or distancing shapes patterns of our inner voice and ability to consciously alter perspectives.

Distancing helps deal with
- big emotions that lead to upset
- Crucial daily emotional challenges
	- Frustration
	- Boredom

Solomon’s paradox
- Given you share similar but independent problem with other, you are able to advice others much better than think of a solution for yourself
