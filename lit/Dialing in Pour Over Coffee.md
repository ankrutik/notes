- [Dialing In Pourovers: A Very Good Guide, Maybe the Best - Lance Hedrick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c34qcTTOLZY)
	- Standard recipe as a baseline. 
	- Concentrate on big variables.
	- What Lance does...
		- Bloom x3 weight of coffee, coarse grind size, bloom from 30s to 2m, then pour rest of water.
			- if draw down too quick, introduce agitation
				- manually
				- split pours
	- Influencers' options might be based on their individual experience on 1 certain coffee
	- Never hit 100% of a coffee's potential. Fine with 80%. Too much work and you speed thru the bag otherwise.
	- Keep building your understanding of what each variable does to the cup.
	- Filter your water.
	- *Read thru the effects first then decide what variable you want to change.*
		- *Are you in the mood to not have your expectations met with the hypothesis of your experiment? How weak are you to confirmation bias right now?*
	- **Ratio**
		- Strength of your cup. Thicker or thin.
		- Lower Ratio...
			- Higher Concentration, Lower Extraction
			- Thicker
		- Higher Ratio...
			- Lower Concentration, Higher Extraction
			- Thinner
	- **Grind size**
		- Coarser
			- Under extraction
			- Lower contact time
		- Finer
			- Over extraction
			- More channeling
	- **Temperature**
		- Higher, higher extraction
		- Lower, lower extraction
		- Going very high, for that coffee, will unlock certain nasties.
	- **Brewer**
		- Wet WDT when not using a cone brewer
	- **Bloom**
		- Decide on the fly how much time
		- 30s, 45s, 1m
	- **Pours**
		- Every time you pour, fines go down and into paper. Boulders go up. This causes paper clog and stalls.
			- Melodrip will reduce this. 
		- Circle in center
		- Shake at the end to level
	- Do not idolize competitions
	- First, tweak bigger variables
		- grind size
		- ratio
		- temperature, 3 degrees Celsius
	- Then smaller variables, maybe
		- bloom time
		- bloom temperature
		- change grinder

	- **Water**
		- 30-50 ppm hardness
		  10-20 ppm bi-carb
	- **Filter papers**
		- Hario old-school un-tabbed
		- Sibarist, highest quality, expensive
		- T90
			- Lance's daily
			- Highest scoring

# Matteo D'Otaavio Light Roast Dial-In Ep. 1 to 3
- Light is difficult to extract
- Fresh water added after full drain of a pour helps extract. Will remaining water, the extraction will not be that much.
- attempt one
	- 95 degrees water
	- Comandante 30 clicks
	- 15:270
	- bloom 40s
	- 40gm x 6
- *wet aroma could be an indication of a good cup. flat flavours there might indicate not an ideal extraction*
- higher TDS is not always better
- mouthfeel and body is associated with extraction
- attempt two, different bag
	- same recipe as before
	- low acidity, sweetness, and body present but he felt it to be over extracted a bit
- Is the coffee easy or difficult to extract?
	- processing
		- ferments are easy
		- washed might be difficult
	- how many days off roast?
		- more days, more soluble because CO2 has degassed
	- roast level?
		- lighter will be more difficult
- *taste is source of truth, numbers for reference only*
- if coarser, you might go weaker intensity
- **what can you change to reduce extraction...**
	- grind size: go coarse
	- water temp: decrease temp
		- won't affect much
	- brew ratio: go lower
	- pouring: less pours
- attempt three
	- changes: 
		- 45gm bloom for 40 seconds
		- less pours: 3 x 75gm pours
	- gained little brightness in aroma
	- lower mouth feel
	- cleaner, better flavour when cooled
	- feels room for improvement
- **number of pours and TDS**
	- 6 gave 1.42 TDS
	- 4 gave 1.27 TDS
- **same recipe comparison between orea and v60**
	- v60
		- higher acidity
		- brighter
	- orea
		- higher sweetness
		- juicier mouthfeel
- attempt four
	- changes from attempt three
		- brew ratio: go lower, from 270 to 250
	- bright, good acidity, juicy, he's happy, good mouth feel and intensity
	- TDS went higher 1.31
- easier to extract, reduce ratio
- you cannot have a recipe for every coffee
- database of recipes to waste less coffee
- attempt five
	- changes from attempt three
		- grind size: 2 clicks coarser
	-  watery, weaker, tea like; but he's happy 
	- aroma delicate and floral
	- this approach needs high quality of coffee
	- TDS went lower 1.17
- **Reducing Extraction...**
	- Better flavour achieved in both attempt four and five
	- But cup profiles changed
	- Reducing ratio increased intensity
		- "juicy"
	- Coarser grind size reduced intensity
		- "tea-like delicate aroma"
	- When you want to dial in to reduce extraction, you know what to do, but ask...
		- Do you want cup juicy?
		- Do you want cup delicate and aromatic?
