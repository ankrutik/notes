	- Standard recipe as a baseline. 
	- Concentrate on big variables.
	- What Lance does...
		- Bloom x3 weight of coffee, coarse grind size, bloom from 30s to 2m, then pour rest of water.
			- if draw down too quick, introduce agitation
				- manually
				- split pours
	- Influencers' options might be based on their individual experience on 1 certain coffee
	- Never hit 100% of a coffee's potential. Fine with 80%. Too much work and you speed thru the bag otherwise.
	- Keep building your understanding of what each variable does to the cup.
	- Filter your water.
	- *Read thru the effects first then decide what variable you want to change.*
		- *Are you in the mood to not have your expectations met with the hypothesis of your experiment? How weak are you to confirmation bias right now?*
	- **Ratio**
		- Strength of your cup. Thicker or thin.
		- Lower Ratio...
			- Higher Concentration, Lower Extraction
			- Thicker
		- Higher Ratio...
			- Lower Concentration, Higher Extraction
			- Thinner
	- **Grind size**
		- Coarser
			- Under extraction
			- Lower contact time
		- Finer
			- Over extraction
			- More channeling
	- **Temperature**
		- Higher, higher extraction
		- Lower, lower extraction
		- Going very high, for that coffee, will unlock certain nasties.
	- **Brewer**
		- Wet WDT when not using a cone brewer
	- **Bloom**
		- Decide on the fly how much time
		- 30s, 45s, 1m
	- **Pours**
		- Every time you pour, fines go down and into paper. Boulders go up. This causes paper clog and stalls.
			- Melodrip will reduce this. 
		- Circle in center
		- Shake at the end to level
	- Do not idolize competitions
	- First, tweak bigger variables
		- grind size
		- ratio
		- temperature, 3 degrees Celsius
	- Then smaller variables, maybe
		- bloom time
		- bloom temperature
		- change grinder

	- **Water**
		- 30-50 ppm hardness
		  10-20 ppm bi-carb
	- **Filter papers**
		- Hario old-school un-tabbed
		- Sibarist, highest quality, expensive
		- T90
			- Lance's daily
			- Highest scoring
