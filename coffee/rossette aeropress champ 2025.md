Reverting to Orea for this one since it is a light roast.

Using a 4 pour recipe with 4th pour in a separate cup.
Starting with 48 Red Clix to go with multiple pours.

>[!note] ### I might want to switch to Aeropress now
>The black tea body is too sharp in a pour over. An Aeropress might round it out. See [[Brewer Choice during Dial In]]
>### Results
>Probably my cough and cold, but couldn't taste any notes as such, The mouth feel of acidity was there. Black tea notes were gone for the most part. Better way to spend this bag.
