> > The Kenyan hits keep on coming! This coffee from Gachatha Factory is standing out with dense pomegranate and juicy, bright gooseberry. This is a "red fruit" coffee, and Scott particularly enjoyed the berry and winey flavors too.  
> 
> > Smallholder farmers bring their ripe cherry to Gachatha, the wet mill, where the coffee undergoes traditional Kenyan washed processing. This particular lot came from the main Kenyan harvest, which is picked from later-maturing, higher-altitude trees.
