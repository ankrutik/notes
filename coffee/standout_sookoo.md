> This lot comes from Shoondhisa, a sub-kebele within Suke Quto. The Suke drying station was the original heart of Sookoo Coffee and played a key role in shaping their quality-driven approach.

> The Suke drying station, nestled in the hills of Shakiso, Guji, was established in 2017. For five years, before the construction of the Sawana drying station and the Weessi washing station, Suke was the beating heart of Sookoo Coffee. Suke purchases cherries from roughly 35 smallholder farmers to produce Shoondhisa lots. This lot is from the Shoondhisa sub-kebele within the Suke Quto kebele. Upon receiving the cherry, Sookoo sorted out any under or overripe cherry and then placed the cherry inside sealed Grain Pro (plastic) bags for 86 hours. After this period of time in a reduced oxygen environment, the cherry was spread on drying tables where it was dried for roughly 25 days.
