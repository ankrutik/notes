options...
Change 1
- 44 clicks

    - 50/55-110
    - should I change temperature?
        - 92 degrees

Change 2...
- segued into v60, 6 pour on a T90, 60 clicks
- light but not much clarity for me
- decent body

Coming back to Change 1...
- sourness has gone away
- nice presence in mouth, salivating
- tad bit overextracted, no jam

*...want to pull back overextraction, want sweeter...*
- Grind size variation can't happen any further
- Reduce ratio?

Change 3...

- 45 clicks
- 50/55-98
- Result
    - Did 50/55-95 instead
    - overextracted feeling has gone away
    - no jam still

*...chasing more sweeter, jam...*
- Reduce ratio further

Change 4...
- Same as Change 3
- 50/55-90
- Result
    - Poured in the living room, so kettle was off the base. Might have lost temperature
    - Nice mouth feel
    - Try this again with proper consistent temperature between pours

***...Happy where this is going...

- Result:
    - Nice mouthfeel, no jam
    - Pati did not like
