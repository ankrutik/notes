## Markings
In order of importance: 
- vertical lines in margin

## Use sticky flags
- Use a sticky note to gather theme of the annotations you come across in reading the book
- Use plastic color flags as per theme of the annotation
	- Specifically plastic because they are translucent and stiff
- Use paper flag-style sticky notes for writing notes and observations of what thoughts/ideas arise in you

- Use colors as per type of book. Write a note in the book's first pages for the legend of the color coding of highlights.
