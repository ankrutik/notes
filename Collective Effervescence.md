#anthropology #behaviour 

- heightened emotional state resulting from simultaneous social participation
- Examples...
	- singing gospel music can bring about a deeper connection to God
	- participating in a meme or TikTok trend
	- social media and religious communities both feed into this
	- make us feel elated
	- confuse this psychological reward with the object of worship.
- Participating in group trends is fun and essential to being human
- Important to remember... 
	- exactly what we’re doing
	- how our need for belonging can be manipulated by bad actors
- The real danger, then, isn’t the ritual itself, but forgetting that it is a ritual in the first place
