#coffee #routine 

After every grind…
1. Clean catch cup and grinder burr bottom area with a tea towel
2. ⁠Phus Phus thru the gap between the burr and grinder body to push back all grounds from the burr into the chamber
3. ⁠Clean the chamber with tea towel. Comandante is wide so my fingers fit. Not sure about Timemore. 

Once a while, will dismantle and go about with a soft bristle toothbrush and kitchen paper towel. Will use the Timemore brush sparingly to reach very small spaces.

Never ever let water touch the grinder.
