#film/direction 

Auteur theory is shown to be applicable only when film crews are small and tight or when the director takes up most of the other work like music, art design, soundtrack, cinematography, etc. 
eg. Rajkumar Hirani and Siddharth Anand films are very different when Vidhu Vinod Chopra and YRF studios are not involved. 
Eg. French New Wave, Satyajit Ray, etc all had tight crews
Counter point Eg. Spielberg, Wes Anderson. Auteur theory then has to also include the rest of the crew. 

Would auteur theory be applicable to social media creators as well?
