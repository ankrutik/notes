## Habit Tracking
Align actions with intent when trying to maintain habits...
1. Is there a point to doing this?
2. Do I really have to be doing all of this?
3. What happens if I stop doing this?

Find a behaviour that is a problem.
Commit to 3 behaviours that could help make today better than yesterday.

Don't "should". Take intentional action.
