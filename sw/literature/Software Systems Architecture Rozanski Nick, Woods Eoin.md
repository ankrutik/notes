# Software Systems Architecture: Working with Stakeholders using Viewpoints and Perspectives by Rozanski Nick, Woods Eoin

## Architecture Fundamentals
Structures
- Static Structures: design time elements like classes, packages, etc.
- Dynamic Structures: run time elements like information flow, caches, etc.

System Properties
- externally visible behaviour: 
	- *what does a system do?*
	- functional specs or features
- quality properties: 
	- *how does a system do it?*
	- performance under load, response time

Principles of Design and Evolution are force consistency in internal implementation and exposing underlying assumptions.

A candidate architecture is a specific arrangement of static and dynamic structures that might potentially fulfill the system's externally visible behaviour and quality properties.

Architectural element:
- clear set of responsibility
- clear set of boundaries
- interfaces that provide a service to other elements

Stakeholders; triangle of quality, time, cost

Architectural Description explains the architecture to the stakeholder

## Viewpoints and Views
View is 
- the representation of one or more structural aspects of an architecture 
- that explains how the architecture meets the concerns of one or more stakeholders

Check following when deciding what to include in a view:
- architectural scope
- element types
- audience and their expertise
- scope of concerns
- level of detail

Viewpoint is patterns, templates, conventions for constructing a type of view.

Viewpoint benefits: 
- separation of concerns that are catered by indepedent aspects
- different communications for different stakeholder groups
- management of complexity
- improved developer focus

Viewpoint pitfalls:
- possible cross-view inconsistency
- selection of wrong set of views
- fragmentation leading to AD difficult to understand

### Catalog
Context:
- relationships, dependencies, interactions between system and its environments

Functional: 
- runtime functional elements
- their responsibilities, interfaces, primary interactions

Information: 
- how does system store, manipulate, manage, distribute information

Concurrency:
- maps functional elements to concurrency units
- how is it coordinated and controlled

Development:
- architecture that helps in building, testing, maintaining, enhancing

Deployment:
- environment where the system will be deployed
- dependencies of the system

Operational:
- how will the system be installed, operated, administered, supported on prod

## Architectural Perspectives
Activities, guidelines, tactics to ensure that a system exhibits certain quality properties across multiple views.

Systemizing:
- determine required quality properties
- assess and review architectural models to ensure that architecture exhibits properties
- identify, prototype, test, select tactics to ensure properties where they are missing

Tactics are not design patterns:
- they do not mandate a particular software structure
- general guidelines on how to design a particular aspect

Apply perspectives earlier in design to avoid going into architectural blind alleys where implementation
- ... is functionally correct
- ... but does not offer quality properties like performance and availability

### Some important perspectives
- Security 
	- controlled access to sensitive system resources
- Performance and Scalability 
	- meeting required performance profile  
	- handling increasing workloads satisfactorily
- Availability and Resilience 
	- available when required
	- coping with failures that will affect availabilty
- Evolution 
	- cope with likely changes
- Regulations
	- confirm to laws, regulations, company policies, rules, standards

### How to use architectural perspectives in different situations
- when working with new area? typical concerns, problems, solutions are not familiar?
	- use as a guide
- need to review models for particular quality property without absorbing new details?
	- use as a store of knowledge
- familiar with environment but don't want to forget anything important?
	- use as a memory aid

### Apply perspectives to views
Architecture Views describs the architecture while Architecture Perspectives guide you thru analysis/modification to ensure quality properties are met.

You can apply all perspectives to all views but you might not always do that.

Create a 2x2 grid, views by perspectives.

See Table 4-1 for *Typical View and Perspective Applicability*

Leads to:
- insights
- improvements
- artifacts: should be preserved

Pitfalls and what to balance:
- applying multiple perspectives to the same view can lead to conflicts
	- multiple quality properties might not be satisfied
- different stakeholders may value one quality property over another
- perspectives contain generalized, established concepts
	-  tweak and apply as per what is relevant to your situation as per relevance and feasiblity


Prioritize and apply only the most relevant perspectives to your architecture.
Selection criteria:
- needs of the stakeholders
- relative importance of quality perspectives to them
- experience and judgement


## Role of the software architect

> Do not think about the solution till you have understood the problem.

Stakeholders will want to think of solutions from day one. An architect has to manage that.

## Glaze
Glaze for soft edges:
1. Apply base colour, let it dry. 
2. Apply next colour on top of it partially.
3. Clean brush and charge with little water.
4. Pull second colour onto the base colour.

- wet on dry
- protect highlights
