#coding/bestpractices #checklist 
- Functions should be as small as possible
	- 2-4 lines
	- Never more than 20 lines
	- One thing rule. Function should...
		- Do one thing
		- Do it well
		- Do that only
	- One level of abstraction thruout the function
		- Step Down Rule of abstraction
			- Top down narrative where every function is followed by functions at the next level
- Blocks and indentation
- Switch statements
	- Violates [[Single Responsibility Principle]]
	- Violates [[Open Closed Principle]]
	- Necessary to use despite problems
	- Bury in a Abstract Factory that will return polymorphic objects that will execute logic as needed
- Descriptive Names
	- long, descriptive name better than short, enigmatic one
- Number of Function Arguments
	- *In arguments* make testing more difficult
	- Information should go out thru return argument not *out argument*
	- Passing boolean to a function means it does 2 things and should be split into 2
	- Zero (Niladic)
		- Ideal
	- One (Monadic)
		- Asking a question, return will be boolean
		- Transforming argument, return will argument itself
		- Event, alter state of system, return nothing
		- Use verb-noun form for function and argument name
	- Two (Dyadic)
		- Avoid
		- Name arguments correctly if both arguments are of same type
		- Can you extract the function into class of the first argument?
	- Three (Triadic)
		- Avoid
		- Group arguments into argument Objects
		- Group arguments into argument Lists
- Avoid Side Effects
	- Side effects are lies where your function indicates something but does something else
	- Creates Temporal Coupling
- Avoid Output Arguments
	- Function must change state of only it's owning object
- Separate Command and Query
	- Function should either return information about object or change its state
- Exceptions
	- Do not return error codes. Throw Exceptions.
	- Extract try catch blocks into function of their own. 
	- Nothing after catch-finally blocks.
- Duplicate code should be extracted into own functions
- Structure Programming principle
	- Every function should have one entry and one exit
	- Single return statement
	- Avoid break, continue in loops
	- Never any goto statements
- Composing Functions
	- First draft will be long, complicated with...
		- lots of indenting, nested loops
		- long arguments
		- arbitrary and duplicate code
		- Suite of Unit Tests that test each line of code
	- Massage and refine code by...
		- splitting functions
		- changing names
		- eliminating duplication
		- Shrink methods and reorder
		- Break out classes
		- Running Unit Tests
- Master programmers write stories using classes as nouns and functions as verbs
