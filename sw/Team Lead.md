	- scale orgs
	- make sure everyone gets attention
- in a new role...
	- "you're doing a good job"
	- mimic others that were in this role
- strongest developers have trouble being managers
- Superman complex "do not jump into solving a problem quickly for a team member"
	- let developers figure out on their own so they...
		- become self sufficient
		- see themselves as trust worthy
		- help each other
	- no judgment to help them open up their creativity 
	- scale yourself by explaining how you...
		- came to the solution?

		- context switching
		- moving around
		- talking to people
		- delegate problems that will take time
	- deep focus time spent in
		- strategic initiatives
- Instinct from existing knowledge

	- "when did the team get behind schedule"
	- hone these instincts
	- detect when others might need help
		- hear something in daily stand up that doesn't feel right
		- can't find root cause of an issue
		- reviewing code
- Digging
	- ask lots of questions
		- before you come up with advice
		- might make the other person come up with solution
	- stand up discussion digging instances
		- has a dependent dev reviewed this?
		- scalability test plan?
		- feature roll-out plan?

	- humble and focused on team
- people are not deterministic
	- code is deterministic, always behaves as expected
