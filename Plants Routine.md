 #plants #routine
## How often?
- Every day
	- Spray
- Once a week
	- Water plants selectively
- Every other week
	- Hydrogen Peroxide, food grade, 3%
	- Seaweed Fertilizer
- Once a month
	- Gentle manual loosening
# Spray
- Every single day, early in the morning
- Special focus on buds and new leaves
- Moisten any moss-sticks
- Hold plants in front of others to re-use errant sprays
- When possible, spray in afternoon for rainbows!
- Use spray bottle that has automatic features.
## Select plants to be watered 
- Dry soil at top 1-1.5 inches
	- Rub fingers to evaluate
- For plants that need moist soil, check for dry-moist soil
- Use moisture meter, but not necessary

> [!important]
> Avoid disturbing the position of delicate plants as much as possible. 
> Philodendrons on the other hand don't care much.
## Watering plants thru bottom feeding
- Preferred approach for small-medium sized pots with airy substrate.
- Use tall vessel that mirrors the dimension of the pot. Use take-away containers.
- Fill the vessel with tap water. Alternatively, use hydrogen peroxide or seaweed fertilizer.
- Submerge the pot in the vessel, wait 15-20 minutes or till you can see the top soil to be beady with moisture.
- Remove and let excess drain. Move the pot in rotating manner to spread the water.

Benefits...
- Encourages roots to grow downwards instead off staying at the top.
- The soil will naturally saturate itself with the amount of water that it can hold instead of being drenched.
## Aerate soil
Use 1 cap of hydrogen peroxide (3%, food grade) in a bowl of water to water plants once every 2 weeks.
### Physical method
- Mostly for compact substrates, dense soil. 
- Do once a month, not too often.
- For plastic pots, press to loosen the soil.
- Small trowel 
	- Be gentle. I've hurt roots of plants!
	- Pull up motion along the sides of the pot 
	- Away from the main root as much as possible
## Fertilize
- Seaweed fertilizer in water
- Fertilizer sticks
## Observe... 
### Roots
- Should be white and healthy
- If not, isolate plants that have unhealthy roots or root rot.
### Leaves
- Plump and bounce
- **Yellowing** may indicate...
	- if soil is observed to be wet most of the time, over-watering
	- if watering is correct, too much sunlight
- **Browning** may indicate...
	- if watering is correct, too much sunlight
	- if light is correct, under-watering
- **Limp-ness** may indicate...
	- if watering is correct, a thirsty plant
	- 
If above corrections do not work, there might be root rot...
- rotten roots
- leaves not recovering
## Common rules when top watering
- Water in spiral manner from the main root
- Water in "sips"
	- Do not water board the pot!
	- Pour little, wait for it to drain out the bottom.
### Amount of watering
- soil is dry, roots are healthy
	- wait for water to seep out at bottom
- soil is moist, plant needs moist soil
	- just enough to keep the soil moist
- plant is recovering from root rot
	- 2 tablespoons of water near main stem
